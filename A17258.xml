            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Generally they teach vs our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty toward our neighbours. But if particularly wee conſider of the chiefe drift of euery precept; the fift Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which is the firſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, inſtructeth how inferiors ſhould behaue themſelues toward their ſuperiors, &amp; withall ſuperiors are put in minde of their duty and place what manner of men they ought to be. The reſt of the Commandements are more generally teaching all of all ſorts or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of life, to haue a care of their neighbours life: in the ſixt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of their chaſtity and pure or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled conuerſation: in the ſeuenth, of their goods and poſſeſſions: in the eighth, and of their reputation and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite or fame: in the ninth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of all maintenance of truth. And in the tenth Commandement wée are taught, that it is not enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe duties to our neighbours
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20189:7"/> in our outward actions only; but alſo that we muſt not cheriſh in our hearts ſo much as a hidden luſt or deſire that may be any way hurtfull to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but on the contrary muſt bend all our indeuour to do them good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>For a ſhort view of the meaning of all the Commandements, let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: But to returne to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, why is it (as alſo many of the reſt are) deliuered negatiuely, or forbidding that which is euill, rather then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding that which wee ought to do, and the thing that is good?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Partly to giue vs to vnderſtand, that holy obedience cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vnleſſe we firſt cleanſe our harts from that which is euil, as God by his Prophet aduiſeth,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.16.17. 1. Pet. 3.11</note>

               <hi>Dwell there</hi> (ſayth God to him) <hi>and make there an altar vnto GOD. Then ſaid Iacob vnto his houſhold, and to all that were with him, Put away the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20189:7"/> ſtrange gods that are amongſt you, and cleanſe your ſelues, Ver. 2.</hi> Partly alſo God deliuereth the moſt of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, forbidding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he would haue his ſeruants to auoide; becauſe he knoweth, and he would alſo haue vs to conſider earneſtly with our ſelues, that we are too ready &amp; prone naturally to ſin; and therefore that our firſt care ſhould bee to deny our ſelues, and our naturall inclinations, that wee may more feruently follow after that which he willeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Doth then this firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment require of vs any more then to take heed that we haue not any ſtrange gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily. For in that it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any other, it teacheth vs that hee, and hée only ought to be acknowledged to be our God. Therefore in the lawe ſuch precepts are very common: <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſhalt ſerue him.</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13</note> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 10.20.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt ſerue him, and thou ſhalt cleaue vnto him.</hi> Yea, hee in his preface vnto his tenne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20189:8"/> Commandements doth challenge vnto himſelfe that honour, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> Neither doth ſo ſpeake this only to the Iſraelites, who were his only knowne people at that time, but euen vnto all vs, who profeſſe that wee are Gods children or ſeruants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. You ſay then that this firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement not onely forbiddeth all ſtrange gods, but alſo commandeth vs to cleaue vnto the true God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But how ſhal we come to a more perfect vnderſtanding of this firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that we know how to keep and obey the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If we truly conſider how many waies we may tranſgreſſe, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take heed to ſhun them: and then remember what God requireth of vs, that wée ſerue and worſhip him, and ſet our ſelues to the vttermoſt of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to doe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Shew me then how many waies this firſt precept may be broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To ſpeake of euery particular ſin whereby this commandement may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20189:8"/> be broken, it is hard: but I ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer certain general tranſgreſſions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which all the reſt may eaſily bée referred, and by which wee may truly examine our ſelues, and accuſe our ſelues of diſobeying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Is not the groſſe Idolatry of the Gentiles a manifeſt breach of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily. And God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complaine of his people, for that they delighted in their abominations: <hi>Deut. 32.21. Ier. 2.5.</hi> and elſewhere very often.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But the Angels are excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, alwaies waiting to do Gods will, may we not ſeeke vnto them for helpe?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Wee may not. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach vs in many places, that they are but miniſtring ſpirits, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnder God for our good, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither are willing of themſelues to do any thing, but when God ſendeth them, nor able by their owne ſtrength or power to helpe vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Yet we ſee in Gods booke, that good men ſometimes haue offered to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20189:9"/> worſhip them: As <hi>Manoah</hi> the father of <hi>Samſon,</hi> as may be gathered by the 13. Chap. 16. Verſe of the booke of <hi>Iudges:</hi> So likewiſe Apo. 19, 10. &amp; 22.8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So it is. But <hi>Manaoh</hi> knew not that it was an Angel, as it is there teſtified, but thought belike that God himſelfe did ſpeak to him: we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo iudge the like of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as that Angell commanded <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, that if he would offer a burnt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, hee ſhould offer it to the Lord:</hi> ſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded by the Angell not to worſhip him, becauſe he is but his fellow ſeruant: but worſhip muſt be done vnto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Some haue worſhipped the hoſt of heauen, and had affiance in thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creatures, as the Egyptians, who called the Sunne <hi>Oſyris,</hi> and the Moone <hi>Iſis,</hi> and worſhipped them. And alſo before them (as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth) the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians accounted the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres; the earth alſo and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for gods, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reporteth in his third booke of the healing the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Grecians.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20189:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt true, but not they only who had leſſe meanes to know the true God. But euen Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple who were acquainted with Gods Law, and were often reproued by Gods meſſengers ſent vnto them for that purpoſe, that they might know and deteſt that abomination: euen they I ſay, are accuſed not only by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> but alſo,<note place="margin">Amos. 5.26.</note> by the firſt Martyr S. Steuen. Although God gaue an expreſſe commandement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,<note place="margin">Act. 7.43. Deut. 17.3.5.</note> 
               <hi>That if any haue gone and ſerued other gods and worſhipped them, as the Sun, or the Moone, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the hoaſt of heauen,</hi> they ſhould be ſtoned to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>It ſeemeth, the excellency of theſe creatures, who are very glorious in mens eies, firſt alured the Gentiles to this folly, and Gods people were deceiued by their example, whilſt they more regarded the dooings of men, which are many times deceitfull, then the expreſſe Commandement of God, which alwaies pointeth to the right way.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:20189:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That muſt needs be granted. Therefore wée muſt hereby take héed, that wee alwaies haue a carefull eye vnto Gods Law, that we may frame all our actions both toward God and toward man, by the right rule of the infallible word. Otherwiſe we may eaſily tranſgreſſe this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as theſe haue done, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after ſtrange gods, bowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Angels, and worſhipping the hoſt of heauen, which were made for our vſe and comfort, and not that wee ſhould ſerue them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Wee haue heard how many wayes ſuch as haue profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Gods ſeruants, haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this firſt Commaundement vnder a perſwaſion (though falſe) of ſeruing God. But may not the ſame alſo be tranſgreſſed by hauing too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in things that cannot helpe?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and that two waies. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hauing too confident aſſurance in other worldly meanes, that we can procure beſides our ſelues: or in tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting too much in our ſelues, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20189:10"/> our owne meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What meane you by them that ſeeke helpe by other worldly meanes then themſelues?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All ſuch as truſt in mens ſtrength or fauour, for which ſinne Gods people are very often bitterly reproued by Gods true Prophets: for they ſo relyed ſometime vpon the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> ſometime vpon the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they thought by their helpe to auoyd Gods iudgements denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them by his meſſengers. Some alſo <hi>put their truſt in Chariots,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 20.7.</note> 
               <hi>and ſome in Horſes.</hi> So did <hi>Pharao</hi> when hee and his people followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but they were all drowned in the Sea.

And ſo world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, as they haue worldly meanes to help themſelues in reſting too much vpon ſuch meanes, breake this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:20189:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But it is not vnlawfull to vſe good meanes to eſcape any trouble or danger, as infinite examples in the Scriptures may teach vs.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True, ſo that we vſe them as meanes only, and not as things able of themſelues to make vs any helpe; but as Gods inſtruments by whom he worketh for our good. Phyſicke is good, if we intreat God by Prayer to giue a bleſſing to it. Strength of men is needfull againſt a mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but the Lord, <hi>Euen the Lord that is mighty in battell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 24.8.</note> doth giue the victorie. The Huſbandman doth huſband his ground and ſow his ſéed, but the increaſe commeth of the Lord. And euery worke of euery man in his calling is good, and attaineth to the end for which it is wrought, if God proſper it: otherwiſe our ſkil, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, wiſedome, and all our indeuours (though very earneſt) are but vaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. By this that hath beene ſaid, it is not hard to gather how many waies this firſt Commandement may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in reſpect of our confidence that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20189:11"/> wee haue in other worldly means: but may not our owne heart alſo beguile vs, and cauſe vs to tranſgreſſe the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, and that two ways, either by inordinate loue euen of things that we may, nay, that wee muſt loue; or by putting affiance and confidence in any thing that we haue, or that we can do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>How can this be, that in louing that which we muſt loue, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, or breake this firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The loue of Parents toward their children, is a duty that muſt bee performed, and commonly is ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, that God ſetteth it as a patterne, whereby he would haue vs to behold his loue toward vs his Children. Yea,<note place="margin">Eſay. 49.15</note> for that cauſe he will be called Father of vs, that the very name wherby we ſpeak vnto Him, may aſſure vs of his loue. The loue alſo of Children to their Parents, of the mutual loue of Huſband and Wife, are much and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commanded: ſo likewiſe the loue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20189:12"/> of Brethren, is ſet for example before vs of a true Chriſtian affection that we ſhould beare one toward another, for it is commended vnto vs by the name of <hi>Brotherly loue.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.10.</note> Yet muſt our loue to God ſo farre ſurmount all theſe loues of any worldly Creature,<note place="margin">Heb 13.1.</note> how deare ſoeuer vnto vs, either by nature, or by any other affection, that if it ſo be that wee muſt ſhew whom wee moſt loue by our obedience, in compariſon of our loue to God, the loue to man muſt vtterly be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and be no loue, euen as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>accounted all</hi> (whatſoeuer holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or righteouſneſſe he might ſéem to challenge by the Law) <hi>to bee but loſſe and dung,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 3 8.</note> 
               <hi>that hee might winne CHRIST.</hi> And this is that hatred of Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Brother,<note place="margin">Luke 14.26.</note> Siſter, yea, and of our own life too, that Chriſt ſaith muſt be in his Diſciples: Not that wee may hate theſe, but that in compariſon of our loue to God, theſe things muſt ſéeme vnto vs. <hi>Abraham</hi> is a true pattern of this loue, who when GOD com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20189:12"/> was willing to haue offered his ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> the only hope of all the promiſes which God had made to him. So wée, vnleſſe we can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to obey Gods will, though Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Wife and Children, and all our friends, yea, though our own luſts, delights, or affections draw to the contrary, doe breake this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, becauſe we rather obey the things that hinder vs, then God who commandeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Your meaning is, that if wee loue any thing ſo, that it may make vs neglect our loue, ſeruice, or worſhip of GOD, euen by that loue we break this Commandement:</hi> Thou ſhalt haue no other God before mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I meane ſo. For, if God were our delight and the ioy of heart, then would our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto other things bee ruled and framed according to it. But if other loues poſſeſſe our harts, they ſit in Gods place, and drawe vs after them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. You ſaid alſo, that this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement may be tranſgreſſed, if we put
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20189:13"/> our truſt or affiance in any other thing but in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True: for if in danger we truſt in our owne ſtrength, as if thereby we can be able to ſtand, or in our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, that by wiles and ſhifts we wil auoid the peril, or in any ſuch help as we think to make to our ſelues; theſe and ſuch like are but lying vanities, of which the Prophet ſaith:<note place="margin">Ionah. 2.8.</note> 
               <hi>They that wait vpon lying, vanities forſake their owne mercy.</hi> Yea, if the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſſure himſelfe of good increaſe, becauſe he hath done the part of a good huſband to his ground, or any tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thinketh to be rich, becauſe he is painefull in his trade; becauſe they make their labour in their calling to be in Gods ſtead, who only muſt giue a bleſſing to all they do, ſuch do tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe this Commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Your meaning is not hereby, to find fault with ſuch paines as men take in their lawfull calling. For, it is the decree of the Almighty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19</note> 
               <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate thy bread. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we call it our bread, as Chriſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20189:13"/> teacheth vs to aske, vnleſſe ſome way or other we labour for it: but when we haue done what belongeth to vs to doe, yet as</hi> Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vaine that build it:</hi>

               <hi>Except the Lord keepe the Citie, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per watcheth in vaine. <hi>So vnleſſe the Lord giue bleſſing to all that we doe, it cannot proſper. For, it is God only</hi> that giueth power to get ſubſtance.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You ſay well: and therefore if we perſwade our ſelues by any ſuch meanes to ſupply our wants, not ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to God by hearty praier to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per our doing; yea if with good <hi>Moſes</hi> wee pray not: <hi>Let the beauty of the Lord our God bee vpon vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.17</note> 
               <hi>and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thou the worke of our hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, euen direct the worke of our hands.</hi> Wee ſhall want the deſired ſucceſſe of our paines, becauſe wee reſt not as we ought to doe vpon help from God, and his direction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may bee taught and guided, with what mind, and to what end wée ſhould labour; namely, for conſcience towards God to liue in our honeſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20189:14"/> calling, not ſéeking with greedie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to inrich our ſelues, but to bée painfull in that ſtate of life that God hath appointed vs to liue in, thereby to maintaine our ſelues and our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and enable our ſelues to doe good alſo to other; and alſo by labour to baniſh the idle life, the bane of al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and root of all wickednes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Hitherto wee are taught, that neither in any religious reſpect wee muſt repoſe our truſt in any but God only; neither in any proud perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our heart muſt we hope for help, in any worldly meanes, how hopefull ſo euer they ſeeme vnto vs; neither yet muſt our loue bee ſo to any thing vpon earth, but that our chief delight may be in the worſhip and obedience of our good God. But as wee haue heard how many waies we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of breaking this Commandement: ſo would I faine vnderſtand what it requireth of vs, that wee may do it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Euen the contrary to the things that it forbiddeth. For as it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all truſt in any thing, but in God
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20189:14"/> only: ſo doth it require of vs that in him wee ſhould repoſe all our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all our wants, dangers, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtreſſe; as alſo the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> aduiſeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.3. verſe 7.</note> 
               <hi>Truſt thou in the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid.)

He truſted not in the armour that <hi>Saul</hi> cauſed them to buckle about him, but caſt it away, and told the proud brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Philiſtim, that hee came with ſword, ſpeare, and ſhield, <hi>but I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come vnto thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi>

               <hi>the God of the Hoſt of Iſrael, whom thou haſt railed vpon.</hi> Now this confident aſſurance cannot flow from any other fountaine, then from a ſetled perſwaſion in our heart, that God is our God, that is in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er able, in mercy willing to make vs all helpe.

               <hi>Q.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Theſe are in deed the generall duties that God here requireth of vs in this firſt precept, whereby we are to learne, that ſeeing we muſt know that all good muſt come from him, we muſt not then thinke that wee can ſo much as offer to God a good thought of our ſelues, much leſſe doe a good deed, vnleſſe he inable vs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt haue the glory of all that we haue or can doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Let vs now come to the ſecond Commandement, wherein (it ſeemeth to mee) GOD teacheth vs how and after what manner hee will bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very true, and it is néedfull hee ſhould ſo do. For when wee are once aſſured that there is a God, our own heart within vs telleth, vs that this God muſt bee worſhipped: and therefore wee ſearch and examine by

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God would not that his people

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>If God meant hereby to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſpirituall ſeruing of him, why did he charge his people by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of</hi> Moſes, <hi>with ſo many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies as hee did, and that euen in that place, and about that very time, that hee gaue the Law of the Commandements vnto them?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God gaue the Law of that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Commandement,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.16.</note> as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> calleth it, for a time to traine his people in obedience to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20189:21"/> him, which in outward obſeruances they would more readily learne; but in ſuch obſeruances as had in euery one of them a ſpirituall meaning, and might haue led them to that true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that GOD requireth, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in. Circumciſion was the firſt that God appointed, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law Moral was giuen about <hi>400.</hi> yéeres. The next vnto it was that ceremonie of the Paſchall Lamb, commanded about two Moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was giuen, as may bee gathered; if wee compare the <hi>33.</hi> of <hi>Numbers, verſe 3.</hi> with the <hi>19.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Exodus, verſe 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What ſpirituall meaning was in thoſe two obſeruances required?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Circumciſion</hi> did giue this to vnderſtand, that they brought with them from their Mothers womb ſuch corruption of fleſh as muſt bee taken away, if they will be in truth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, &amp; therfore that they ſhould looke farther then to the outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie. <hi>For if thou be a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Law, thy circumciſion is

               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.25</note> 
               <hi>as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. For he is not a Iew, that is one outward, neither is that circumciſion that is outward in the fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> 
               <hi>But he is a Iew</hi> (that is a true ſeruant of God) <hi>that is one within, and the circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the heart, in the ſpirit, not in the letter</hi> (or outward obſeruance) <hi>whoſe praiſe is of GOD,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 29.</note> 
               <hi>and not of man.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ieremie</hi> calling the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to the true conſideration of that ceremonie, wherein they ſo iuſtified themſelues aboue other that were not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thus exhorteth them,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>Breake vp your fallow ground, and ſow not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thornes; be circumciſed to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your hearts.</hi> So that this ceremony giuing them to vnderſtand, how by naturall birth all fleſh is corrupted and ſinfull, they ſhould acknowledge their pollution, and indeuour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>And is this all that circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on teacheth?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, It aſſureth them alſo of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20189:22"/> grace and mercy. And therefore is it called the <hi>Couenant,</hi> which is indeed as is called in the next verſe <hi>the ſigne of the Couenant</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>between mee and you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17.11</note> Becauſe God thereby aſſured to them the bleſſedneſſe that he promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſéed. In which reſpect alſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Abraham receiued the ſigne of circumciſion,</hi>

               <hi>as the ſeale of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Faith which he had, when he was vncircumciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Circumciſion was then vnto the people of Iſrael, as the ſacrament of Baptiſme to vs.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is very true, ſauing onely that in the outward ſignes they differ.

               <hi>Q. I ſee plainly, that by that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the people of God were not only put in mind of a temporal happineſſe, but had alſo promiſe of eternal glory, in which reſpect,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the Lambe it ſelfe muſt be without mayme or ſpot, of a yeere old, a Weather Lambe, to point to the great perfection that muſt bee in him that ſhould frée vs from ſin; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſay, then can bee in any man, conceiued according to the common courſe of nature. It was to bee kept from the tenth day of the Moneth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20189:23"/> the foureteenth, ſhewing that, as the Apoſtle ſaith;<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note>

               <hi>Q. This that hath bin ſpoken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Lambe it ſelfe, and how it ſhould be vſed, and the bloud ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Now let me heare how the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſhould eat the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Some of the Ceremonies vſed in eating of it, ſignified their ſpeedie departing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as wee muſt vpon any occaſion offered, ſpeedily and in haſte ſhake off the fetters of ſinne: ſuch was their eating with ſhooes on their feete, their ſtaues in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20189:24"/> their hand, and perchance their ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it, and their eating it with vnle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened bread (for they might not ſtay to ſowre it with leauen.) Their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with ſowre hearbes, might put them in mind of their hard diet in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore make them more thankfull when they came to better: Or els rather, that being made free from that <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet many aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be looked for. Hereby alſo we ſee, that though we be freed from the bondage of the ſpirituall <hi>Egypt,</hi> the power of ſin: yet wee ſhall haue many ſharpe combates with our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, and many afflictions in this life; for ſuch is the eſtate of Gods ſeruants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Many moe ſuch Ordinances were commanded to Gods people, wherein the outward ſeruice was very particularly ſet downe, and ſtrictly obſerued of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But without the ſpirituall meaning thereof, they might well be compared to the Nut before it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For keepe it vncracked neuer ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20189:24"/> long, you haue no good therof, open it and taſt of the kirnell, it is pleaſant: euen ſo, the ceremonies of the Law, except the inward meaning therof be practiſed, are ſo farre from pleaſing God, that he reiecteth, nay, he hateth the ſame, as hee often profeſſeth, and moſt plainly in the firſt and laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What was then that ſpirituall ſeruice, ſignified by their waſhings, their ſin offerings, their ſacrifice of perfumes, peace offerings, and ſuch like?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Their waſhings and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were commanded, taught them that they of themſelues were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane vntill they were waſhed, and alſo that this cleanſing was but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, and directed them vnto that ſanctifying ſpirit mentioned,<note place="margin">Eſay 44.3.</note> without which no man can be cleanſed. The ſacrifice of perfumes ſignifieth our Prayers, which cannot be a ſacrifice of ſwéet ſauour to God, but by the mediation of that high Prieſt figured by that Prieſt-hood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20189:25"/> muſt offer <hi>much odours with the prayers of the Saints.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 8.3.</note> The offerings for ſinne, teach Faith &amp; Repentance: Repentance, I ſay, in that the beaſt they brought did but ſupply their roome, and was ſlaine, to ſhew what they deſerued, and withall, that it now behooueth them to <hi>crucifie the old man,</hi> and all thoſe corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the fruits of our ſinfull nature, and to reſt only on the bloud of Chriſt (whereof the bloud of thoſe beaſts was a repreſentation) to make the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onement with God. And thus much by way of digreſſion, to ſhew that theſe externall rites which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his people to vſe for a time, namely, vntil the fulneſſe of time was come, that God ſhould giue his Son to take our Nature vpon him, and wherein hee taught them, that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently &amp; truly vſed them, both Faith and Repentance ſhould bee no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the Idolatrie and groſſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies vſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Idoll ſeruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. It is plaine then, that as in this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20189:25"/> Commandement God requireth ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worſhip, and forbiddeth that ſeruice, that by Images or the likenes of any thing, men offer vnto him, ſo alwaies euen when ceremonies were moſt commanded, the ſpirituall and inward worſhip of the heart only ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned that outward ſeruice, and made it acceptable. Then they are in my iudgement much to be blamed, who ſtill retaine in their Churches, or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or any where elſe, the Images ſo expreſly forbidden by God himſelfe, for adoration ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are ſo, but yet to couer their ſhame, they haue certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to make ſhew of reaſon for their doings, but much like <hi>Adams</hi> fig-trée leaues, which could not hide him from God. Neither can all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to anſwere the words of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement, although they haue found out many bad ſhifts. One <hi>Ambroſe Catharine</hi> affirmeth this Law to haue been giuen onely to that people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a time, but that it belongeth not to vs. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:20189:26"/> himſelfe is aſhamed of that anſwer, and reiecteth it, in his ſecond Book of Images Chapter <hi>7.</hi> Many of them ſay, that in this Commandement the gods or Idols of the Gentiles are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, not the Images which Gods ſeruants do make. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teacheth, that this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbiddeth only the Image that is accounted a god, or repreſenteth as a God, that which is none, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chap. before alleadged. <hi>Caietan</hi> another great Papiſt, would make vs beléeue, that not euery I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is here forbidden; but that it is vnlawfull for a man to make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, that he will haue as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar god. Laſtly, as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the firſt, in that abſurd Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> the ſecond, writing to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Irene</hi> his Mother, very Pope-like expoundeth that Commandement, not to forbid holy Images (now wee deny that in this caſe there be any ſuch) but <hi>Agal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> which hee expoundeth to be the Image <hi>abiecti animalis,</hi> of ſome baſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20189:26"/> creature. To anſwere euery one of theſe their anſweres particularly, would be too long. But the precept it ſelfe being thus generall as it is, is without any further anſwere, to ſhew the abſurdity of all theſe anſweres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. The Commandement forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all likeneſſe of any thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in heauen, earth, or the waters, neither hath reſpect vnto the Images, by whom they are made, or of whom they haue been worſhipped, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſly forbiddeth all. But becauſe they like beſt of that which <hi>Bellarmine anſwereth, that thoſe are onely forbidden that are accounted as gods, I pray you ſhew your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, whether they in their worſhip of Images, whether of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Men, or Women, ſeeme not to make them as gods.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Howſoeuer the Papiſts would ſéeme to deny this, (for ſuch Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is too groſſe and abominable) yet themſelues muſt confeſſe, that in their owne Prayer-Bookes, they pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as if they were gods, they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20189:27"/> vſe knéeling, cenſing, kiſſing, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Candles before them, and whatſoeuer we muſt aſke of GOD, they aſke of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But they doe not begge theſe things of the Images, but of the Saints whom theſe Images do repreſent.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In déed ſo they ſay, but what can they do more, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtood before them, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints (for ſuch outward worſhip) then they do to their Images? Neither is it likely that the common people is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put ſuch difference betweene the Image, and the thing thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. Seeing in that aſſembly of their Biſhops and learned Clergy, in the ſecond <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, one of them could ſay,<note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> 
               <hi>It is plaine, that hee who worſhippeth the Image, and ſaith, This is Chriſt, ſinneth not.</hi> It is no ſin with them to ſay the Image is Chriſt: ſhall the people then thinke they neede bee ſo ſcrupulous, to put ſuch difference between the Image, and him that is ſignified therby? Nay, I dare ſay, the Prieſts would not haue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20189:27"/> them ſo well learned, as to know that difference. For the things ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully offered in many places, can doe no good to the Saints themſelues, (for they who are dead, whether good or bad, neede not the things of this world) and the Image it ſelfe neuer was the better for any thing that was offered, neither could haue any vſe thereof, (for what can ſtockes and ſtones do with gold or ſiluer, or Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of price?) It is therefore a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrine that the ſimple ſhould be taught, that their prayers and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (for doubtleſſe to whom they pray, they alſo offer) I ſay, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the Church-Romiſh to teach, that they pray not or offer to the Image, but to the Saint repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereby: Leſt a Chriſtian ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riouſly conſidering of the matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as a name due to God only,<note place="margin">Pſal. 65.2.</note> to be a hearer of Prayers, and not belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto the Saints, and therefore alſo ſaith, that all fleſh ſhall come vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to GOD: the ſimple man then thus
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20189:28"/> concludes with himſelfe, Seeing my ſeruice muſt not be to the Image, and the Saints cannot heare or helpe mee, it is vaine that I pray or offer before them. Againe, wee ſée the practice not onely of vnlearned men, but of their learned and religious men to the contrarie of their doctrine. We read in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, ſo much eſtéemed of the Romiſh-Church for ſetting vp Images,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> how one <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> told them a tale of one <hi>Iohn</hi> an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and Anchorite, a man famous, ſaith this <hi>Dennis.</hi> This <hi>Iohn</hi> had in his Cell where hee lay, the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and his faſhion was when he went abroad, as he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for <hi>5.</hi> or <hi>6.</hi> moneths together, to make a candle, &amp; being ready to take iourney, he prayed to our Lady (as he termeth her) <hi>Totus in Imaginem eius intentus, <hi>wholly reſpecting her Image, Thou holy Mother of God, becauſe I haue a long iourney in hand, care for thy Candle, and ſee that it burne not out. And hauing ſpoken thus to the Image, he tooke his iourney.</hi>
               </hi> Is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20189:28"/> this a plaine teſtimony of praying to the Image it ſelfe, and allowed in that Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> for good ſtuffe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>It is ſtrange, that any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the name of Chriſtianity, could ſo break this Commandement of the Almighty in making Images to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſeeing, euen diuers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers that knew not the true GOD, thought that things that cannot be perceiued by outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but by vnderſtanding only, muſt be by Faith comprehended, as</hi> Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret <hi>out of</hi> Parmenides, Solon, Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>&amp;</hi> Antiſtenes <hi>teacheth in his third Booke againſt the Idolatrie of the Gentiles. Yea, hee there reporteth, that</hi> Antiſtenes <hi>would not that any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſhould be made of God, becauſe ſaith he, God cannot by any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit or picture be comprehended, but by beleeuing: and therefore very apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calleth Faith</hi> the Eye of the mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Certainely, theſe Heatheniſh Philoſophers ſhall riſe vp in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt theſe Popiſh Idolaters, to whom wee may truly ſay, as there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20189:29"/> 
               <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaketh to the Gentiles, that worſhipped the creature in ſtead of the Creator, and fell downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Images: <hi>Solis viſibilibus contabeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis manu<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan> confecta ſimulachra vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, doctrinam quae de inuiſibili traditur non admittitis: <hi>You euen pine away</hi>
               </hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>about things viſible, and worſhipping Images made with hands, you receiue not that which is taught of the inuiſible God.</hi> And in deed the Romiſh Church ſo doteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for their Images, that they little reſpect Gods word in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Can that be true?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt true. For when they ſaw that they could deuiſe no good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to warrant their Images from the force of this <hi>2.</hi> Commandement, and that the words were ſo plaine, that they in kéeping their Images muſt be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted tranſgreſſors of the lawe, in ſo much alſo as <hi>Vaſquer</hi> a Ieſuite confeſſeth, that diuers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are againſt the making of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, as alſo ſundry of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20189:29"/> ancient Fathers: when, I ſay, this Commandement was ſuch a blocke in their way, that this and their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Images could not wel ſtand together: then they began to looſe this knot, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did that Gordian knot in the Temple of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo;</hi> hee cut it in pieces with his ſword. So haue the Papiſts handled this Commandement, they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe no anſwere to ſtop the mouthes of their aduerſaries, and therefore in their Catechiſms they quite leaue out this Commandement. <hi>Vaus,</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus pſalter, both in Engliſh, an olde office of the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more then forty yéeres ſince: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a new Breuiary or Office of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in Engliſh and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. A booke intituled, <hi>Bulla ſuper forma iuramenti, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his catechiſme, all of them leaue this Commandement quite out, as if God had neuer ſpoken ſuch a word, not fearing the curſe pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as put or take any thing from Gods word.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:20189:30"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But this Commandement for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not the making of all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For the repreſentation of men or women, whom for their authoritie or other good parts in them wee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or loue, is not vnlawfull; or if they be made to garniſh and beautifie any place, or in any other ciuil reſpect, this Commandement is not thereby broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Moſt true; and therefore in the commandement it is ſayd, Thou ſhalt not bowe downe before them or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, thereby teaching vs what Images they are, whoſe making is in this commandement forbidden. And in theſe words wee are to learne, that all kind of honour externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, of the body, or of the Spirit, is vtterly vnlawfull to be done to thoſe Images.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But they make vs to beleeue who are ignorant people, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that is done before the Image, is not done to the Image, but to that which the Image repreſenteth.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So they teach, but the practice
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20189:30"/> of learned and vnlearned ſéemeth to bee contrary. For it is very hard to finde any among the ſimple, who if they confeſſe the truth, do not kneele and pray to the Image it ſelfe. Yea, why doe they ſo trim vp, with clothes of price and precious Iewels, their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? why doe they make them to ſpeake, as did that at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> whereof <hi>Pollidor Virgil</hi> in his hiſtory of England, in his ſixt booke repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth? why do they deuiſe to make them turne away their faces, to auert their eyes? ſometime alſo to fome at their mouth, and make ſuch tokens of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſed, when their offrings doe not come in ſo plentifully as they haue done? Are not theſe things done, that the Image it ſelfe might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reuerenced and worſhipped? To what end is the incenſe offred or the candles lighted before them? The things by them repreſented ſtand not in need of any light; if they be ſaints, they ſee by a much more glorious light, if not, the taper-light cannot pleaſure them. Neither can the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20189:31"/> of the Incenſe come to the place where Gods Saints liue in eternall bliſſe; or if it could, might it pleaſe them any thing, who are wholly raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in beholding the vnſpeakable glorie of God, and all whoſe exerciſe is to ſing praiſe and glory vnto him that ſitteth vpon the throne, and to the Lambe. And that idolatrous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Niece,</hi> called, the ſecond Nicen Councell, hath many things to iuſtifie this that wee accuſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church of; namely, that they do honour to the Image it ſelfe. There was one <hi>Iohn,</hi> intitled <hi>Sanctiſs. Praeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, <hi>a moſt holy Prieſt,</hi>
               </hi> who ſaid, it was a cleere caſe, that <hi>He who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Image,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.</note> 
               <hi>or ſayd, This is Chriſt, ſinned not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another telleth a tale of <hi>Iohn</hi> an Abbot, whom hee commendeth very much to be famous in his time, who vſed oft to goe on pilgrimage. And his manner was when he would take any iourney in hand, to make a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and ſetting it before the Image of the bleſſed Virgin which hée had in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20189:31"/> his cel, <hi>Totus in Imaginem eius intentus, <hi>Being wholly deuoted to her Image,</hi>
               </hi> thus to ſay: <hi>Thou holy Mother of God, take care of this thy candle, and as I would haue it, keep it that it goe not out;</hi> and ſo when he had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fiue or ſixe months, at his return hee found the candle burning. And there is alſo another ſuch like tale of a woman, that was at great charges to digge a Well, and could get no water, vntill ſhee had put an Image into the Wel, and then ſhe had plenty of water.<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> Much ſuch good ſtuffe there was in that ſecond Nicen Councell, giuing much honour to the Images themſelues as if they knew not that olde Verſe:

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. It ſeemeth then, howſoeuer they now would ſeeme to giue no
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20189:32"/> honour to the Image, but to that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is thereby repreſented, yet the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appeareth ſo plainly, both by their words and deedes, that they muſt bee holden guiltie of the breach, at the leaſt, of this part of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherin external ſeruice of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You iudge truly. And that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worſhip alſo which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth in this word, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſerue them:</hi> they giue to other the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages contrary to this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the Saints thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, and that is contrary to the firſt commandement. For if we truſt in any thing but in God, looking for help from them, it is as before is ſayd, a plaine breach of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other god before mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. The Romiſh teachers make vs beleeue, that there is one worſhip that they giue vnto God, another wherewith they honour the Saints, and therefore will not confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be tranſgreſſors, either of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20189:32"/> firſt, or this ſecond Commandement in worſhipping the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is true, that they ſpeake of two ſorts of worſhips, one belonging vnto God, another, ſay they, may be giuen to the creature; the firſt they call <hi>Latria,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Doulia,</hi> which diſtinction, howſoeuer it may ſéeme to haue ſome ſhew of antiquity, yet (if it bee truely examined) it hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of verity. For firſt, the words themſelues differ not in ſignification, but both ſignifie ſeruice, vnleſſe <hi>Doulia</hi> (which ſeruice they reſerue for the Saints) be more baſe ſeruice, and therefore more fit to giue to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reaſon would wee ſhould more humble and ſubiect our ſelues vnto God, then to any creature. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is hard for a ſimple man to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference between theſe two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, becauſe howſoeuer their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſay, the one ſeruice belongeth to God, the other to Saints: yet if thou looke vnto the outward behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they are alike to both. We knéel to God, they to their Saints, if not to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20189:33"/> their Images, wee lift vp hands and eyes to God in our prayers, ſo doe they to their Images, or to their Saints at the leaſt: yea they ſet lights before them, and offer vnto them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, which is more then wee doe to God, becauſe hee néedeth it not. To be ſhort, with greater ſolemnity by far, they obſerue their Saints daies then the Lords day. So that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the Saints in outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is in euery thing equall to that of Gods with them, in ſome things much greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But in the ſpirituall honor they tell vs there is great difference. For theſe acknowledge God to be the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all good things. As for Saints, they make them but Aduocates to God for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If this which they ſay were true, yet it were intolerable wrong ſo to rob Chriſt of his office. For <hi>if any man ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>we haue an Aduocate with the Father, euen Ieſus Chriſt the Iuſt: And hee is the propitiation for our ſinnes. It is he alſo that is at the right
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20189:33"/> hand of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.34.</note> 
               <hi>and maketh requeſt for vs.</hi> But they content not themſelues thus to rob Chriſt of his office of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, but that alſo they rob God of his glory, and that mo wayes then one: That appoint to euery Country their peculiar Saint, to be, as it were their Patron; as to <hi>England,</hi> Saint <hi>George;</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Andrew;</hi> to <hi>Spaine,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames,</hi> and to other countries, other Saints, wherein they imitate the Gentils, who had for euery Country and City their ſeueral gods, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie for Chriſtians, and <hi>Theodoret</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Idolatries of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in his third booke doth charge them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. It ſeemeth they haue forgotten that it is God who diſpoſeth of the greateſt Monarches at his pleaſure, and bringeth their kingdomes to an end when hee will. If that watchfull keeper of Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 121.4</note> 
               <hi>who doth neither ſlumber nor ſleepe, <hi>doe not protect, not all the Saints in heauen can worke ſecurity: and if God be with any Kingdome or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20189:34"/> Citie, or houſe to defend it, not all the powers of the earth, nor all the diuels in hel, ſhal any thing annoy it. So that the godly may with much ioy &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſay;</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.12</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are all they that truſt in the Lord: <hi>And</hi> Bleſſed is the Nation, whoſe God is the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.12</note> 
               <hi>the people that hee hath choſen for his inheritance. <hi>But the ſimple may iudge, that without all doubt in this, the Romiſh Church giue that honour to the Saints, that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to God onely; yea, and that in much greater aboundance to them, then to God. For the ſeuenth day, which God himſelfe commanded to be ſanctified vnto him, which is now vnto vs the Sabbath, or the Lords day, is nothing ſo ſolemnely kept as thoſe Saints dayes are, vnleſſe they fall vpon the Lords day, and then God for their ſakes ſhall bee ſerued after their beſt maner, not they for his ſake. But you ſaid that ſundrie waies they rob God of his glory, I pray you let vs heare more of this.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Praier belongeth to God only; firſt, becauſe hee commanded ſo, <hi>Call

               <note place="margin">Pſa. 50.15</note> then alſo it is a ſpiritual ſacrifice, one of them that the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.5</note> 
               <hi>Wee are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a holy Prieſthood, to offer vp ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices acceptable to GOD by Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſacrifices were not to bée offered to any but to God. Thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practice and examples of al the godly, whoſe praiers we read of in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures teach this. And the reaſon is, becauſe they did know it was Gods office onely to heare our prayers. <hi>O thou hearer of praiers</hi> (ſayth <hi>Dauid) to thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 65.2</note> And the Godly confeſſe, that <hi>Abraham was ignorant of them, and Iſrael knewe them not</hi> (yet I hope theſe were as good Saints, as any that the Romiſh church can affoord vs) <hi>Thou O Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>art our Father and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>

               <hi>and magnifie him with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi> And hee confeſſeth this will pleaſe God better then a ſacrifice. So elſewhere the Prophet exhorts Gods people to <hi>offer ſacrifices of prayſe to God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.22. Chap. 14.3</note> which are called by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, The calues of our lips:</hi> and by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes: The fruite of the lippes to confeſſe Gods name;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 13.15.</note> and muſt alwaies be offred to God, as there the Apoſtle exhorteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. It ſeemeth then, that God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth as due to him, all religious ſeruice outward and inward, of the body and of the mind, ſo as wee muſt <hi>loue the Lord our God,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>with all our heart, ſoule, and might: <hi>ſo muſt wee ſerue him too. What ſeruice then is that of</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, <hi>which the Saints muſt haue? For all this that is ſpoken of, is</hi> Latria; <hi>and therefore, by their owne confeſſion is due to God only.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I know not any religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that their ſaints can haue (much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20189:35"/> leſſe their Images) vnleſſe they rob God of his honour, as they haue done hitherto, and Chriſt of his office: or els that they muſt returne to Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme or Iudaiſme, to borrow ſome rites and obſeruances of theirs, as their lights, their cenſing and many ſuch like. But the true honour that wee can giue vnto the Saints, is to commend as patternes of godlineſſe and religion, their vertues to others, and our ſelues to imitate the ſame. Thus howſoeuer they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this diſtinction, when it is examined, wee finde that they are all one, and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, but that indifferently they are vſed to ſet forth the ſeruice of GOD, but neuer for Saints in Scripture; yea, and the word it ſelfe vſed in the originall, becauſe it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and ſignifieth all kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, euen that which is done vnto men, and not only that which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to God, may plainly teach vs, that Gods meaning was not to allow of any ſuch diſtinction, as now is vſed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20189:36"/> for maintenance of Idolatry, by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh teachers, far otherwiſe then euer S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (vpon whom they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it) did meane.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. This is then the ſumme of that which hath been ſayd, that any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſeruice, whether outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that is done to any Image, or the likeneſſe of any thing, is a breach of this ſecond Commandement. And becauſe they ſay, it is not done to the Image, but to the Saint thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, therein they doe againſt the firſt Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement; of which, though we haue heard before in expounding the firſt Commandement, yet vpon occaſion, ſomewhat alſo hath beene ſayd in teaching the things required in this ſecond Commandment of that too. And is there not any thing els forbidden in this ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then this making and ſeruing of Images?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes; for we may make Idols of our owne fancies, or of ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines as God hath not commanded or taught: but becauſe my meaning
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20189:36"/> is briefly to touch the moſt plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Precept, although I might iuſtly haue ſpoken againſt all doctrines and traditions of men, not grounded vppon Gods vndoubted word; yet I meane rather to omit them for this preſent time, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the words of the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and point vnto that only that may plainly be gathered out of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. What may we learne out of the reaſon, that is added in the end of this Commandement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It ſéemeth to be a general induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to obedience of Gods lawe, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the ſinners by feare of Gods terrible iudgements, and withall, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them knowe, that by their ſinne they ſhewe themſelues to bee ſuch as hate God: And incouraging and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forting ſuch as by their holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhew that they loue God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But what more ſpeciall reaſons are in the Scriptures, to worke in vs a deteſtation of all tranſgreſſion againſt this Lawe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Diuers: and firſt, the great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20189:37"/> care that God did ſhew, when he gaue them his lawe, in that hee did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in any likeneſſe, ſo that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard his voice, but ſawe nothing; to the end (as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) <hi>that they ſhould not corrupt themſelues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.15 16.</note> 
               <hi>and make them a grauen Image or repreſentation of any figure.</hi> Secondly, whereas the Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers would tell vs that Images are Lay mens books, which they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Gentile Idolaters, the Spirit of God, which can more truly iudge of them what theſe are, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny popiſh Idolater, telleth vs that <hi>The ſtocke is a doctrine of vanity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 10.8.</note> and an <hi>image is a teacher of lyes.</hi> And muſt not they, who looke vpon ſuch bookes, be led into errour? Thirdly, the men of God ſpeake of them ſo ſcornefully in the Scriptures, as if they diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ſuch as profeſſe themſelues to be Gods ſeruants, ſhould eſteeme of them, as that they are the worke of mens hands, eyes haue they but ſee not, eares and heare not, &amp; ſuch like. Yea the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> telleth vs, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20189:37"/> men are in their Idolatry ſo beſotted, and witleſſe, that hauing roſted their meat by one piece of a trée, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues by another piece of it, of the third they make a god. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if there were no other reaſon, yet this one may make vs to deteſt them, becauſe that wheras God is a Spirit, and they who will worſhip him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> muſt worſhip in Spirit and truth: (for ſo Chriſt teacheth vs) the beholding of their painted Images or otherwiſe richly decked, doth not a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the mind from heauenly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meditations, and ſo hinder our true and ſpirituall ſeruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. The third Commandement hath in it, I ſee, a prohibition or forbidding of that which is vnlawful, and a reaſon why we ſhould obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But may wee not in diuers things tranſgreſſe againſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes verely: we haue ſo many by-waies to leade vs out of the right path of holy obedience, that it is very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20189:38"/> hard to walk in it without wandring, for in thoſe things wherein Gods name ſhould be glorified (ſuch is our corruption) wee many times diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him: for ſwearing, if it be in ſuch ſort as it ought to be, is a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, and God is glorified thereby. And therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the calling of the Gentiles, and that they ſhall ſet forth Gods honour, ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſ. 45.23.</note> 
               <hi>Euery tongue ſhall ſweare by mee,</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>They ſhall ſweare by the Lord of Hoſtes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſ. 19.18.</note> but yet it is but too true, and greatly to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that by ſwearing, the name of the Lord is taken in vaine, and ſo this Commandement broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But ſome ancient Haereticks thought, and the Anabaptiſts now maintaine an Oath, to be vnlawfull.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo, but their errour may well bee confuted by diuers reaſons: For firſt, there are many good vſes of an Oath, as the ending of ſtrife and controuerſies,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.8 11.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might ariſe among neighbours, as in ſuch caſes as are ſet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20189:38"/> downe. Therefore the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eb. 6.16.</note> that <hi>an Oath for confirmation is among men an end of all ſtrife.</hi> Secondly, it hath beene vſed for aſſuring of bargaines and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants, as betweene <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 21.31.</note> And when <hi>Iacob</hi> bought <hi>Eſaus</hi> birth-right, hee made <hi>Eſau</hi> to aſſure the ſale thereof vnto him by an Oath. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 25.33.</note> an Oath hath been vſed to bind more ſtrongly the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to faithfull ſeruice,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.9.</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſwore his ſeruant, when he ſent him to get a Wife for his ſonne <hi>Iſaak:</hi> and the Subiects to loyalty &amp; alleagance. So did <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> take an oath of alleagance of <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> king of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and God called that oath his Oath,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 36 13.</note> and threatneth grieuouſly the King and people for breach of that Oath.<note place="margin">Ezech. 17.18.19.</note> But beſides theſe good vſes of an oath, we ſée it is often commanded in the Scriptures, which ſhould rather be forbidden, if it were vnlawfull. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God,</hi>

               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.34.</note> 
               <hi>Sweare not all: <hi>after whome, alſo Saint</hi> Iames <hi>the Apoſtle taught the ſame leſſon.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Theſe words being truely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, make nothing to maintaine their errour. Chriſt reproueth in the words alleadged, two corruptions of thoſe times concerning Oathes. The firſt, that if they ſwore by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though in them Gods Maieſty doth ſhine, they did imagine they took not the name of God in vaine. But Chriſt telleth them, that his honour is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20189:39"/> ſo tyed vnto his creatures, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing his glory, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſweare by them. The ſecond corruption was, that they had theſe Oathes in their common talke, and as it ſeemeth, were of that mind that many now are, that ſo they ſwore tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſinned not. Chriſt therefore teacheth them, that in their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ordinarie talke, they ſhould vſe no ſwearing, but they ſhould ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirm a truth, or deny an vntruth; which hee meaneth by theſe words, that their communication ſhould bee yea, yea, nay, nay, and whatſoeuer is more, commeth of euill.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.37.</note> And S. <hi>Iames</hi> thus expoundeth theſe words of our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>that their yea, ſhould be yea, and their nay, nay,</hi> that is, whether they affirme or deny, it ſhould be true that they ſay. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Oathes, then ſuch as are vſed in ordinarie or common talke, and in déed are too commonly vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, there is nothing in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>I ſee then it is lawful to ſweare:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20189:40"/> but teach me, how in Othes the name of God may be taken in vaine.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, by falſe ſwearing: for the end of an Oath ſhould be to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the truth, and to make it known, that might otherwiſe lie hidden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs. If then the taking of the name of God worke not this effect, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vaine. God therefore by his Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> teaching his people, how they might keepe themſelues in this point from breaking this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,<note place="margin">Iere. 4.2.</note> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſweare, The Lord liueth in truth, in iudgment, and in righteouſneſſe.</hi> And by the ſame Prophet reprouing his people for their hypocriſie,<note place="margin">Ier. 5.2.</note> ſaith thus, <hi>Thogh they ſay, The LORD liueth, yet they ſweare falſely.</hi> Yea, he giueth a plain Commandement,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.12.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>If then the end of an Oath bee to diſcouer a truth, what ſhall wee thinke of the doctrine of aequiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which teacheth not onely to deny a truth, but to do it vpon an Oath, and thinke they do well, that ſo forſweare themſelues?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> I ſay, it is a doctrine very fit and ſutable to the Prieſts &amp; Ieſuits, who mainetaine the ſame, for as they ſtriue as much as they can, to take all truth out of the Church, ſo do they heereby what in them lyeth, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Faith &amp; honeſt dealing from among men. For, when men may not be truſted vpon their word, no not vpon their Oath, but that ſtill they may ſuſpect ſome ſecret reſeruations to be hidden in their deceitfull hearts, what ſafety can there bee in dealing with ſuch men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Let theſe Aequiuocatours then paſſe as wilfull tranſgreſſours of this third Commandement, and as wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiuing others by their moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious doctrine: is this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broken only by falſe ſwearing?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is broken alſo by all vaine ſwearing, for as wee muſt ſweare in truth, ſo in Iudgement alſo, as out of <hi>Ieremie</hi> I ſhewed before. And this word of iudgment doth ſignifie,<note place="margin">Iere. 4.2.</note> either that the Oath muſt be taken before a Iudge, as in the caſes formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20189:41"/> out of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 22.8 &amp; 11.</note> it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or at the leaſt iudicially in matters of great importance, and for ending of waighty controuerſies, as the Oathes that the godly of whome I ſpoke before were made; but to cal God to witnes in matters of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a great diſhonouring of Him and his name.

            <p>
               <hi>Q. Beſides the vaine matters that men ſweare for many times, ſuch othes bring men to a cuſtome of ſwearing, whereby this Commandement muſt needs bee broken, and they who vſe ſuch oathes, are in danger to be ſnared thereby.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, If wee thinke or ſpeake
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20189:42"/> of Gods works with leſſe reuerence, and due conſideration, then we ought to do, thereby is the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement broken. For, as men by their names, ſo is the glory and Maieſtie of GOD apparant vnto vs by his works, ſo that his power and might, his wiſedome, his mercy, may eaſily bee ſeene to them that reuerently conſider of his creation of all things of nothing, of the order wherein hee hath made and appointed them, &amp; how he hath made all his creatures for our vſe. And in his gouerning the world as hee doth, both his iuſtice and his greatneſſe may be ſeene. So that to talke of his works, and not worthily to praiſe the workemanſhip, or not to giue honour to the worker thereof, is to take his name in vaine, becauſe that which may be knowne of God, is not ſo reuerently eſteemed of vs, as it ought to be.</p>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very much: For a vow is as it were a holy promiſe, not made, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God, and whereof hee is a witneſſe, but alſo made to him, and therefore not without great diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his name, can bee broken or left vnperformed.<note place="margin">Num. 30.3</note>

               <hi>Q. You meane not heere to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the godly the popiſh vowes, wherein they who haue vowed, do ſo much reioyce, as if they were the chief profeſſors of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, thoſe Popiſh vowes are commonly to abſtaine from things lawful in themſelues to be vſed, with ſuch a bond of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>
               <hi>Q. We learne then that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement may be broken, by ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, either falſly, or vainly, by talking of Gods workes vnreuerently; by vowing or promiſing to God, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to performe the ſame, by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate wiſhes and wandring praiers; and laſtly, by making profeſſion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, when wee ſerue our owne luſts, ſinne, or Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is true: But one thing I had almoſt forgotten. For wée diſhonour Gods Name, not onely in our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring prayers (as is before ſayd) but alſo in praying to him for things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20189:45"/> or that againſt our enemies hee would bee an executioner of our wrath. In all theſe or ſuch like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, we diſhonour the name of the Lord our God. And alſo in oathes, beſides falſe and vaine ſwearing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prooued to be againſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, it is a great diſhonor to Gods Name to match him with any other in ſwearing, or any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of GOD, as Gods people did, for which, GOD by his Prophet threatneth to deſtroy the land, and to cut off the people, and the beaſts, the birdes, and the fiſhes alſo; and this ſéemeth to be a great cauſe of that generall deſtruction, becauſe <hi>they did worſhip and ſweare by God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.5</note> 
               <hi>and by Malcham.</hi> For our great and mighty God, who gouerneth all things as he will, ſcorneth ſo vnequally to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with Idols, or any creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Now beſides all theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of this Commandement, we read, that God very often findeth fault with falſe prophets, that came in his Name when hee ſent them not,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20189:46"/> ſpoke in his name, when hee bid them not, and made the people beleeue they were his true Meſſengers, &amp; yet were nothing leſſe: Did not ſuch take the name of the Lord in vaine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Certainly they did. So that as by that which hath formerly bin ſaid, we haue learned how euery man may tranſgreſſe this Lawe: ſo here we are taught how theſe in their particular function do grieuouſly and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly for other, breake this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And herein do all popiſh, and other falſe Teachers, wickedly offend, in that they vaunt themſelues as meſſengers from God, to teach his truth, when they ſpeak of nothing but their owne fancies, and mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnleſſe as graceleſſe murderers will caſt Sugar vpon poiſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him that eateth it, ſo they now and then alleage ſomewhat out of Scriptures, to make their hearers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that al that they deliuer is like that, when their doctrine, and Gods word in his booke deliuered, are no more like then night to day, darkneſſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20189:46"/> to light, or Antichriſt to Chriſt. And thus much for this third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I meane for the things prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But what is required in this Commandement that we ſhould do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He who will not that wée diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour his name, would haue vs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in ſanctifying the ſame. For, as Chriſt ſaith;<note place="margin">Mat 12.30</note> 
               <hi>Hee that is not with mee, is againſt mee, and hee who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth not, ſcattereth.</hi> So hee who honoureth not GOD, diſhonoureth him, whenſoeuer occaſion is giuen to honour him, in that hee omitteth that dutie.

               <hi>Q. It appeareth then, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting or forbidding to diſhonour Gods name, doth neceſſarily containe in it a commandement to honour the ſame; and that worthily. For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of his Name, is the firſt thing that our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught vs to begge of God, in that forme of prayer which he hath taught vs, which we call the Lords Prayer. Therefore, as you haue taught vs, how his Name may be in diuers ſorts, or many waies diſhonoured, ſo let vs heare how wee may apply our ſelues to honour the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, if we do the contrary to thoſe things, whereby Gods name is diſhonoured: As if taking his name in ſwearing, we ſweare alwaies tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in iudgement, or for deciding
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20189:47"/> of controuerſies of weight or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; if wee thinke or ſpeake of his workes reuerently; if wée performe the holy meanes which wee haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in our hearts, to vſe to furder vs in his ſeruice; if in our ſhort and ordinary wiſhes, or ſolemne prayers, wee with feare and reuerence ſue to God ſeriouſly: laſtly, if our outward profeſſion of religion bee ioined with care and indeuour to ſerue God tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and walke worthy of our calling, by theſe meanes we ſhall rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this holy ſeruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Are there not ſome particular or ſpeciall obſeruations, which if wee follow, we may more religiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelues to all theſe duties before mentioned?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes verily, and briefly they are theſe: A diligent hearing or reading of Gods word.

               <hi>Q. <hi>What is meant by the words following: For the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God thereby moueth this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take heed that they offend not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this lawe. For, many go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in their ſinnes raſhly, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as man doth not, ſo God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſpy; or at the leaſt doth not ſee their wickedneſſe, or if he ſee, yet he regardeth it not, or that hee will not puniſh, or that he is not of power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. For what is ſo abſurd that vngodly men will not ſurmiſe, to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues in their owne waies? therefore, God heere giueth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to vnderſtand, that if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20189:49"/> his name, they prouoke againſt them the LORD himſelfe, whoſe All-ſéeing Eye beholdeth the very thoughts of the heart, and whoſe Power is infinite, and not to bee hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by any deuice or policie, or to be reſtrained by any ſtrength of man: <hi>Who if he wher his glittering ſword,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>You told vs in the beginning, that the fourth Commandement (if it bee well obſerued) is a very good meane to inſtruct vs how wee may performe theſe duties vnto God, and to furder vs in doing the ſame.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It it moſt true: for it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20189:50"/> the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, that is vpon that day, the occupying of our ſelues about ſuch holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as might rauiſh our hearts with a conſideration of Gods goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and his wiſedome in all his works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>This Commandement, as it is repeated by</hi> Moſes <hi>in the fift of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy, is this,</hi> Keep the Sabbath day to ſanctifie it, as the Lord thy God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee, <hi>and ſo forth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 12. verſe, to the end of the 15. wherein I obſerue ſome things that ſeem not to belong vnto the firſt table of the Commandements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as yet we ſpeake.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That is truely obſerued. And for your better vnderſtanding of this commaundement, you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that firſt the commandement it ſelfe is giuen in theſe words; <hi>Keepe the Sabbath day.</hi> Then is the chiefe and principall end why it ſhould bee kept, mentioned. Afterwards the commandement it ſelfe is explained; namely, what God requireth of vs, or

            <p>
               <hi>Q. That I may particularly bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in this Commandement; I pray you firſt to teach mee the precept it ſelfe, what is thereby meant, Thou ſhalt keepe the day of reſt. Are all workes forbidden in theſe words?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from God himſelfe concerning this point,<note place="margin">Leuit. 23 8</note> 
               <hi>The ſeuenth day is a holy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20189:51"/> conuocation, in it thou ſhalt doe no ſeruile worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But what are thoſe ſeruile workes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The works of euery mans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall vocation, wherein he is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his labour, either for the good of the common-wealth wherein hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, or the maintenance of his owne eſtate and of his family. Which workes, becauſe they are eſpecially wrought in reſpect of this preſent life that here wee liue, in compariſon of thoſe that aime at the euerlaſting life, are worthily called ſeruiſe, becauſe that curſe of God belongeth to theſe our bodily labours: <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>vntill thou returne to earth.</hi> And ſeruile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they may be called, becauſe (for the moſt part) they are not wrought with ſuch ſincerity &amp; reſpect to Gods glory as they ought, but ſauor ſomewhat of our corruption, and are too much inthralled to either our gréedy deſire to inrich our ſelues by painful trauel, or ambitiouſly ſeeking prayſe of men,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20189:51"/> or are otherwiſe ſowred with ſome ſuch leauen, and ſo ſerue in ſome part at the leaſt our polluted and naughty affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But being commanded to keep the day of reſt, we are not forbidden all kind of workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. For there are workes of Religion, ſuch as were circumciſing the children, which if the eight day, wherein by Gods Law they were to be circumciſed, fel vpon the Sabbath, was to bee performed without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of this Law,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.22.</note> as our Sauiour Chriſt affirmeth. And the killing of the Sacrifices vpon the Sabbath day muſt be done.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.5</note> So the paines or labor in comming to Church vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, is a labour not only lawful, but commanded, and neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all Chriſtians as a duety that they muſt performe. Some other are workes of neceſſity; as if an Oxe be fallen into a pit vpon the Sabbath day, it is no breach of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to pull it forth.<note place="margin">Luke 14.5</note> But here we muſt deale wiſely, and ſincerely. For,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20189:52"/> if any buſineſſe may without great danger bee put off vntill another time, then this is not a work néedfull to be done that day: ſo that euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion cannot make a worke of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, but only danger of great hurt or loſſe. There are alſo works of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whereof Chriſt giueth this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.15</note> 
               <hi>Doth not euery one of you looſe an Aſſe or Oxe from the ſtall, and lead him to the water on the Sabbath day?</hi> Such workes are the viſiting of the ſicke, comforting of them that are in heauineſſe, and ſuch like works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Among the workes of charity; many reckon this, that they make drinkings, &amp; gather great companies together vpon the Sabbath day to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ſom poore man, as their pretence is: may not this be truly accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the works of charitie that this day may be performed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. For when a worke that ſeemeth to proceed from a charitable affection toward man, is croſſed by ſome commandement of the firſt table (all which belong to the immediate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20189:52"/> honor of God) thou muſt rather ſhew thy loue to God then to man. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they who will not chooſe other daies wherein they may performe duties of loue towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then that which God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for to honour him in, doe plainly ſhew they loue their owne profit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then either God or their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, becauſe they take ſuch time only to do good to their neighbour, as God challengeth to be honoured in, being loth to leeſe the work of a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Is there then great neceſſity in conſecrating the Sabbath day to a day of reſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very great, as may appeare by the charge that is giuen. For the word, Kéep the Sabbath, the word, I ſay, vſed in the Hebrew, requireth oft a great and diligent care in kéeping that which is there commanded, as <hi>Deutero. 8.11. &amp; 24.8. 1. Kings 2.3. 2. Kings 11.5.</hi> In all which places and many ſuch like, the ſelfe ſame word is vſed that here <hi>Moſes</hi> hath; to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20189:53"/> ſhewe the watchfull care wee ſhould haue to kéepe this day of reſt. Yea God himſelfe in giuing this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,<note place="margin">Exod. 20</note> giueth it with a <hi>memento. Remember, that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day. Remember,</hi> not onely when it commeth, to keepe this day of reſt from bodily labour, but thinke of it before hand. As a wiſe builder wil prouide his ſtuffe néedful for his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that when the work is in hand, nothing bee wanting. Or a diſcreet Captaine purpoſing to fight with his enemy, will muſter his Souldiers, appoint his Captaines and Officers, furniſh them with armour, weapons, and victuall, and all things needfull, that when hee goeth to encounter his aduerſary, there be no want: euen ſo God would haue vs to conſider all the weeke before what we haue to doe on the Sabbath day, that wee might ſo diſpoſe of our ſixe dayes of work, that the ſeuenth might bee wholly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (without any let) vpon Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>This Commandement requireth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20189:53"/> not onely the reſt of the maſters, or chiefe of families but of ſeruants too, that they ſhould not be appointed to any labour that day. And therefore they who ſend their ſeruants vpon er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands vpon ſuch daies (which is a ſin wherein too many offend) tranſgreſſe this Commandement. They likewiſe who appoint the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are vnder them (ſo they worke not their wonted worke) to doe other buſineſſe either at home or abroad, and thinke they breake not the Sabbath, are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo. Yea, God hath ſuch care that ſeruants ſhuld alſo reſt that day, that hee would the cattell ſhould reſt, leſt by any meanes the ſeruants (if the cattel reſted not) ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to work. And that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement might more religiouſly be obſerued, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtranger (though hee were not tyed to ſuch lawes as Gods people were) yet being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods people, might not worke that day, leſt his example might bee hurtfull or offenſiue to other.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:20189:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>I ſee then, that there muſt bee reſt from our ordinary labour, vpon the Sabbath day. But is it enough that wee reſt from worke? is that a ſufficient ſanctifying that day?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: for the end why we ſhould reſt from bodily worke, is that wee might be wholy occupied in <hi>Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, and apply our ſelues to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Then to bee idle, is not the reſt that is heere commanded, much leſſe to beſtow that day or any part of the Sabbath in excesſiue drinking, feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or gaming.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You ſay truely: for the reſt from bodily labour is to this end one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the mind of men being occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpirituall and heauenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they might more aſſuredly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that ſweet reſt and quietneſſe of conſcience, which is, <hi>that Peace that the world cannot giue,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>I pray you then, teach vs how wee may ſanctifie this day of reſt, in

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Wée muſt vnderſtand, that this Commandement, as it was giuen vnto all that God brought out of the houſe of bondage, euen to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> aſwell as to the people, ſo is it generall now, and belongeth vnto all ſtates of life, to all callings, to Men, and Women, and euery body in his place muſt ſeeke to further this worke. The Magiſtrate and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, the Paſtor and the People, the Maſter and the Seruant muſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to helpe forward, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zephanie</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.9</note>

               <hi>Q. Hath the ciuill Magiſtrate any thing required at his hands, in this ſanctifying of the Sabbath, but that for his owne ſelfe and his houſehold, hee be carefull to reſort to the holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of that day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, he is alſo bound euen by this Commandement, in reſpect that the talent of gouernment is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20189:55"/> to him from God, firſt, to haue a care that good lawes be made againſt the prophanation of the Sabbath: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to take order that ſuch Laws be duely executed, and puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted againſt offenders, as Law commandeth. Heereof wee haue in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> a godly patterne for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who ſéeing the Sabbath day (when the people of the Iewes were returned from the captiuitie of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>) wickedly prophaned by treading Wine-preſſes, ſelling Grapes and ſuch like labours, earneſtly reproued them for it, yea, and the Magiſtrates too with theſe words,<note place="margin">Nehe. 13.15.17.</note> 
               <hi>What euil thing is this that ye do, and breake the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day?</hi> And the night before the Sabbath he cauſed the gates of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to be ſhut, and ſet his ſeruants to watch the gates that none ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the ſame, but they ſhould be kept ſhut vntill after the Sabbath day: ſo that he kept the Marchants, which by their bearing of burthens prophaned the Sabbath day, without the walles all night once or twice. But ſeeing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20189:55"/> them ſomewhat obſtinate and loth to be reſtrained, he alſo threatned them, that if they came any more in ſuch ſort to offer ſuch prophanation on the Sabbath day, hee would force them by violence to depart. By which Story that is left vnto vs as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable fact, for all Magiſtrates to imitate, wee ſee how carefull and how earneſt Magiſtrates ſhould bee to ſhew themſelues as the LORD hath appointed them, <hi>Conſeruatours of his Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>As for Miniſters of the word, we know that their vocation is holy, and ſhould eſpecially bee directed to the true ſanctifying the day of reſt.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt true, that wee haue a holy calling, which that wee alſo ſhould walke in holily, it were to bee wiſhed. But as this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was giuen to <hi>Aaron</hi> as well as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the people, ſo no doubt, wee muſt haue great regard to the ſanctifying the Sabbath day, and go before other therein, our ſelues I meane and our houſholds, that by our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20189:56"/> example other may the rather be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to this holy reſt. And beſides thoſe duties that God requireth of vs in regard of our generall calling to Chriſtianity, wee haue a ſpeciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto the Miniſterie, whereby we muſt ſtriue to the vttermoſt of our power, to call our people to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Sabbath day, to teach them how the day is to bee ſanctifyed, to exhort ſuch as are ſlack, to reproue ſuch as obſtinately offend therein, and by all extremity that we can, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to the ſanctifying thereof. And wee muſt do this as God hath inabled vs, ſincerely, and ſeeking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the glory of GOD, not our owne praiſe, or moued by any other corrupt affection, if we will truly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally teach our people to ſanctifie the Lords Sabbath. For how much the more zealouſly, and from a ſanctified heart the word is deliuered, the more powerfully (no doubt) will it worke a godly reformation.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> All Parents, and heads of houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds muſt further this duty like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to haue a great care that their children and ſeruants prophane not the day that God commandeth to bee kept holy.

               <hi>let vs go vp to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of <hi>Iaacob,</hi> and hee will teach vs his waies, and wee will walke in his paths.</hi> Come, let vs go to the Church, let vs reuerently heare his word, let vs not ſpend the day in drinking, wantonneſſe, or idleneſſe, that God bids vs beſtow in holineſſe, yea, and ſeruants and children ſhould frame themſelues willingly to perform this duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Wee haue heard what perſons ſhould be furtherers to this worke of ſanctifying the Sabbath. Now let vs heare what duties are required of vs,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20189:57"/> to the ſanctifying thereof.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> If wee will holily, as wee ought, apply our ſelues to this holy ſeruice, wee muſt beginne with our ſelues, for vnleſſe wee be firſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.18.</note> our ſeruice cannot be holy: <hi>An euill tree cannot bring forth good fruit,</hi> ſaith He that cannot lye. The Prieſts in the Leuiticall Law, when they went about that holy ſeruice that belonged to their office, muſt firſt themſelues bee ſanctified.<note place="margin">Exod. 28.41.</note> And therefore <hi>Ioſiah</hi> that good King, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue the feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer kept,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 35.6.</note> commanded the Prieſts to ſanctifie themſelues for that ſeruice. And God commanded the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ſanctified,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.10.</note> when he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to declare to them his Law. Good <hi>Ezechia</hi> therfore intreated God to be mercifull to ſome that came out of ſome Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the feaſt of the Paſſeouer, <hi>that prepared their whole heart to ſeeke the LORD,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chro. 30.19.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they wanted the Legal ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. This good foundation of ſanctifying our ſelues, beeing thus
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20189:57"/> layd, all that wee doe will bee better accepted with God. Then muſt wée carefully follow all the holy exerciſes of that day: ſuch as are theſe; hearing of the Word attentiuely, and as men greedy to learne, Praying to GOD feruently, for the aſſiſtance of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in all our godly indeuours, yeelding to him moſt hearty thankes for his graces beſtowed vpon vs, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference when wee are out of the Church one with another, of the leſſons that we haue heard by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Word, company with ſuch as can and will inſtruct vs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reading to vs good Bookes, or by godly talk either of Gods goodnes to our ſelues, or his mercy ſhewed to others, or his fearefull iudgments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, for contempt of Him and his truth: or generally, of his wonderfull works in creating all things in ſuch order as they are, and all for our vſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. I perceiue, they that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and with ſanctified hearts doe keepe the Sabbath day, may find much
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20189:58"/> comfort in ſuch holy exerciſes, but how may wee ſanctifie our ſelues?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is a harder worke then wee are able to performe; yet, if we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily call vpon God for his grace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating Him to worke that in vs, which wee of our ſelues are no way able to doe, and then keepe a carefull watch at the dore of our lips, that we ſpeake not vnaduiſedly, and haue a watchfull eye vnto our waies, that we walke warily: if (I ſay) in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, wee thus ſeeke to prepare our ſelues, to ſanctifie our ſelues to this holy reſt, no doubt, God wil giue a bleſſing to theſe our good indeuors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Alaſſe then, how lamentable is the caſe of many in our dayes, who ſpend ſcarcely one hower of the day in the Church, and thinke that time alſo (how ſhort ſoeuer) long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? But in the Ale-howſes, or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly feaſts and meetings, which too many reſort vnto, they willingly tarry very long: yea, the whole day ſeemeth too ſhort, when it is beſtowed ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly againſt Gods expreſſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In truth, the careleſneſſe and ſupine ſecurity of men in theſe our dayes, is much to be pittied, wherein many, who haue the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp; would ſcorne to be deemed not to be ſo; haue onely heard of GOD, and are acquainted with the name of Chriſt, and ſo by continuall company among Chriſtians, haue ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of good words; but yet are ſo careleſſe to attaine to any true knowledge, by the light of Gods word, ſo godleſſe and irreligious in prophanation of the Sabbath day, ſo wholy deuoted to ſuch vnchriſtian méetings, and ſo looſe &amp; lewd in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour when they are there, that if any Turkes or Infidels ſhould behold their conuerſation at ſuch times, they would then deteſt the very name of Chriſtianity ſuch ſtaines are they to the very profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But God forbid, all that reſort to ſuch meetings were ſo vnruly: ſome are more moderate, and come but at the intreaty of their friend, or for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of their neighbours or fellowes,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20189:59"/> not delighting much in drinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True, ſome are more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but he that is moſt moderate, if he truſt too much in himſelfe, that he can in ſuch dangerous meetings car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelfe ſoberly, may ſoone bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and therefore may ſeeme by his ouerboldneſſe to tempt God, as preſuming of his own naturall diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And let all men aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues heereof, that God in his iuſt iudgement forſakes them, and leaues them to themſelues, who contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do breake his Law. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if their friend intreat them to diſobey Gods Commandement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting vpon the Sabbath day to ſuch feaſts, it is the part of a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, rather to moue his friend to deteſt his wicked prophanation of the Lords Sabbath, but in any wiſe let not the ſeruant of God conſent to his wicked perſwaſion.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.2</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do euill,</hi> much leſſe one ſeducing friend. And ſince they ſay they go with their friend, and thinke that ſhould ſerue to make their fault

               <note place="margin">1.

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What are the reaſons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Iſraelites are mooued to obey this Commandement?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The firſt reaſon is, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, which <hi>Moſes</hi> heere in repeating the Law, ſetteth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20189:60"/> forth and ſtrengtheneth, partly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, in calling him Lord, partly, hee allureth them to performe vnto this Commandement willing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe he hath many waies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to bee their good and gracious God, whom they cannot diſobey, without great note of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes. Secondly, in giuing them <hi>6.</hi> daies, to ſupply all wants of their body; and for diſpatch of their worldly affaires, hee reſerueth onely one, to be wholy imploied in his honor and ſeruice, the beſtowing of which day in ſuch ſort as wee ought to doe, is alſo moſt to our owne good, becauſe it is the gaining our ſoules to God. I ſay, by this his large allowance of ſo many daies for bodily labours, they iuſtly are to be charged with a ſtaine of ingratitude, if they willingly giue not this one day to holy and ſpirituall exerciſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Are we ſo tied in the ſixe daies to labour in our calling, that we may not in them reſort to places where
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20189:60"/> Gods word is preached and taught?</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20189:61"/> will alſo, the more diligently early or late, follow the works of their calling to ſupply their wants, and ſuch faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care of ſeruing GOD, ſhall not want a bleſſing from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But may a pretence of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch holy exerciſes, be any excuſe to ſuch as will perchance beſtow a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time that way, and then the reſt of the day they imploy in idleneſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It ſeemeth there were ſome ſuch, whereof the Apoſtle admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.13.</note> and they were young widdowes: but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> liked not of their doings, and would not in any wiſe that ſuch ſhould be tolerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But what thinke you of theſe words,</hi> Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour? <hi>They ſeeme to be a Commandement, and to require the labour of ſixe daies, euery man in his calling.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are vnto the godly a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or permiſſion to follow their vocation, and to worke for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of themſelues and their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But they haue alſo the force of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20189:61"/> a commandement, to the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vngodly, that ſpend their life in loitering and idleneſſe, and may worke in them a ſting of conſcience, when they ſhall remember that God ſaith, <hi>Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour,</hi> and their own heart telleth them, they haue not wrought, but loitered. For ſéeing God hath after mans fall, ſet this downe as a Decrée, that may not be altered (vnleſſe we ſpend our time in ſome religious exerciſe, as before I ſayd) <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat thy bread:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> good and godly is the exhortation that the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the <hi>Theſſalonians, to worke with their hands;</hi> as hee alſo before had commanded them,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.11.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Q The Commandement of God,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20189:62"/> if there were no other thing to moue GODS people to obedience in this thing, ought to be ſufficient, but much the rather, ſeeing God hath dealt with them ſo fauourably, as to haue conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their wants, that they might haue time to ſupply them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is yet a third reaſon to moue them then, and vs alſo now to ſanctifie the Sabbath, in theſe words; <hi>But the ſeuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> For God challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this day as his due, and not to be ſpent, but as he appointeth; that is, in holineſſe and ſanctification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>But the ſeuenth day which is here commanded, is not that which now we call the Sabbath day; ſo that it ſeemeth wee tranſgreſſe this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, howſoeuer we keepe our Sabbath.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Indéede the day here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as that alſo wherein God reſted, was the ſeuenth day of the wéeke, and the day that we keepe and indeuour to ſanctifie, is the firſt day of the wéek. For that ſeuenth day being ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20189:62"/> and ſo by the comming of Chriſt aboliſhed (for he was the end and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all the ceremoniall Lawe) needefull it was that the chiefe and moſt ſubſtanciall end of that ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhould bee ſtill retained, that is, that one day ſhould bee wholly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Gods ſeruice. And this day which we now ſolemnize, being the firſt day of the wéeke, was vpon good ground thought to be fitteſt; becauſe, as God reſted the ſeuenth day from his worke of creation: and therefore that day was then thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, to bee vnto his people a day of reſt: So Chriſt riſing againe from his worke of redemption, vpon the firſt day of the wéeke, the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed by the Spirit of God, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this firſt day of the wéeke had their holy aſſemblies, as is moſt plaine, <hi>Ioh. 20.19.26. Acts 23.7.</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and of the worke that Chriſt wrought in riſing againe, it is called, <hi>The Lords day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reu. 1.10</note> And by this is there (as it was fit) a difference put betwéene the Sabbath of the Iewes,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20189:63"/> and that which we kéepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Almoſt in the very beginning of handling this fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ſayd that there was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end why wee ſhould keepe this day of reſt, which I think is this, that you haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of already, the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it.

               <hi>A. Moſes,</hi> a true expoſitor of Gods meaning, expreſſeth it in theſe words <hi>That thy man-ſeruant and thy mayd may reſt as thou doſt.</hi>

And to the end they might more willingly giue this time of holy reſt vnto their ſeruants, hee putteth them in minde of their ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in <hi>Egypt,</hi>

For, the ſuperiors in this their ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, haue a great repreſentation of the power and care that good Parents haue ouer their children.

            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What is meant by this word honour?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt it teacheth vs, that ſuch dutie as wée owe to ſuperiours muſt willingly be performed. For honour is a reuerent affection imprinted in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20189:65"/> our hearts toward others, without forcing or conſtraint; without which affection of the minde, the outward ſhewe is ſcarce a ſhadow of honour, and is many times done by cap and courteſie, or ſuch outward reuerence, to them who are contemned and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them that doe it. So did the Gouerners ſouldiers to Chriſt, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon him a ſkarlet robe, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his head a crown of thorns, and in his right hand a Reed (for a Scepter.) Then they bowed their knées before him and mocked him, ſaying:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.29</note> 
               <hi>God ſaue thee, King of the Iewes.</hi> Then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that which here is called honour, is elſewhere expreſſed by the name of feare. <hi>Yee ſhall feare,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Why is the mother named in theſe words before the father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe, through the greater familiarity that the mother hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with the children, they becom leſſe awfull to their children (for ſuch is our natural corruption, that where we haue any hope of liberty, wee will
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20189:66"/> too readily ſéeke for more then wee ſhould haue, or can well vſe.) Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, leſt this our badde inclination ſhould too much abuſe the mothers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; it is in this commandement eſpecially prouided, that the mother be feared; and that wee ſhould haue a ſpeciall regard thereof, the Mother is firſt named as the Parent that is in greateſt danger to bee wronged, and to haue her due honour taken from her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. This honor then that inferiors owe to their ſuperiors, becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo called feare, as you haue taught, ſeemeth to bee nothing els but a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpect vnto our betters, and that child-like feare which the Scriptures teach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.</note> 
               <hi>to be the <hi>beginning of wiſedome;</hi> if it be the feare of the Lord. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, no doubt this feare or reuerent reſpect of our betters, frameth vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more ſincerely to perform all duties vnto them. But as you haue taught what perſons are to bee honoured, as Parents, Kings and his inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters and Maſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20189:66"/> and likewiſe, what is meant by this tearme of honour, ſo for my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſtruction, vouchſafe to handle more particularly the particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are due to euery of theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> You muſt vnderſtand, that this honour or reuerent feare heere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is as it were a roote, out of which the ſeuerall duties to euerie of our ſuperiors doe growe. So that where that is truely planted, there will bee no want of honour to them, to whom honour belongeth. And firſt to begin with Parents who are here expreſly named, becauſe they were firſt that among men were honoured, and children (if they be not too grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) haue euen naturally an inclina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion to reuerence them, ſo that they ſeeme to bee ſet as a true patterne of ſuch ſubiection as becommeth all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors: to begin, I ſay, with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and to ſhew how they of their children muſt be honoured, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man teacheth thus,<note place="margin">Pro. 23.22</note> 
               <hi>Obey thy Father that hath begotten thee, and deſpiſe not thy mother when ſhe is old.</hi> The
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20189:67"/> Apoſtle alſo,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.1</note> 
               <hi>Children, obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Lord; for that is right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Obedience then, I ſee, is one of the fruits that ſpring from honor w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is commanded. But is it ſufficient that children bee obedient when they are commanded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Nay, the very aduice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Parents ſhould be reuerenced alſo, and is whereſoeuer the true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour towards Parents is ſeated. And ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth, <hi>My ſonne, heare thy fathers inſtruction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 1.8</note> 
               <hi>and forſake not thy mothers teaching. Bind them alway vpon thine heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 6.21.</note> 
               <hi>and tye them about thy necke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But alas in our wicked dayes wherein wee liue there are too many who little regard either the counſell or commandement of their Parents, but the more fatherly and kindly they are dealt withall, the more ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they diſobey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The cauſe thereof is much in the folly of the Parents, who are ſo tender ouer their children, that when they offend, they cannot finde in their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20189:67"/> heart, they ſhould be corrected. <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes is bound in the heart of a child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22.15</note> 
               <hi>but the rod of correction ſhall driue it away from him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 23.14</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt ſmite the child with the rod, and ſhalt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſoule from hell.</hi> But if in their youth they bee not corrected for their diſobedience, the father and mother ſhall find them like to trées, which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but young might bee bowed any way, but being come to ſome growth, will by no meanes be bended, and ſo ſhall know by experience, that a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or <hi>fooliſh child is the calamity of his father.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. If wee obey and harken to the Commandements, and follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of our Parents, haue we then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all the dutie that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement requireth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: For children muſt furder haue a continuall care euery way to be a ſtay &amp; comfort to their Parents, if by their ſtrength they may helpe their weakneſſe; if by their ſight they may guide their blindneſſe; if by their wealth they may ſupply their want;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20189:68"/> if by their knowledge they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their ignorance; if by their paines they may eaſe them of trauell: to be ſhort, if their place, their credit or reputation, their acquaintance or any other meane that they haue may doe them good, they muſt by all ſuch means which they haue, teſtifie their honour to their Parents. A notable example wee haue in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who did euery way honour his father <hi>Iaacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7.14</note> and relieued him and his family in number <hi>75.</hi> when there was a great dearth in the land. Therfore the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> thus exhorteth: <hi>My ſonne, helpe thy father in his age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>and greeue him not ſo long as he liueth; if his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding faile, haue patience with him, and deſpiſe him not when thou art in thy full ſtrength.</hi> And Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth the Scribes and Phariſes, becauſe that vnder colour of their blind deuotion they hindered children from performing this honour.<note place="margin">Mat. 15.4, 5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But Chriſt hath commaunded, <hi>Call no man father vpon the earth, for there is but one,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15.9</note> 
               <hi>your Father which is in

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The words of our Sauiour Chriſt are not ſimply to be vnderſtood but comparatiuely, as if he had ſayd: If the queſtion be,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37</note> whether thy heart ſhall bee more tied to God, or to thy earthly father, thou muſt without all doubting or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation, wholy addict thy ſelf to thy heauenly Father. For <hi>He that loueth father or mother more then me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not worthy of me: &amp; he that loueth ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Yea, in another place, hee wils that we hate all theſe things, yea, and our life alſo, or els we cannot be his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. In all which,<note place="margin">Luke 14.26.</note> Chriſt teacheth vs to honour our father, but ſo, as we obey God, to loue him that begate vs, but yet more to loue him that made vs. He would haue vs to diſtinguiſh aright betweene the loue that wee owe to God, which muſt be, with all our heart, and ſoule, and minde, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20189:69"/> with whatſoeuer wee haue, and the loue to Parents, which is thus limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it muſt bee in the Lord, that our obedience alſo may be framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. How children ſhould honour their Parents, we haue now heard. But what honour is due to Princes &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Such like as to Parents. For as Parents are ouer their children, ſo are Kings and Magiſtrates ouer their ſubiects, and ſuch as are vnder their charge. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> giueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charge vnto <hi>Titus</hi> thus: <hi>Put them in remembrance</hi> (with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art, and whom thou haſt a charge of) <hi>that they bee ſubiect to principalities and powers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.1</note> 
               <hi>and that they bee obedient. Bee yee ſubiect to euery ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the ſuperiour: or vnto gouernors, as vnto them that are ſent of him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.13 14.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1</note> that <hi>Euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers: Not only for feare of

               <hi>Q. To performe the honour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; what other thing beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is required of vs to doe to Princes and Magiſtrates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We muſt afford them mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fit both for their eſtate and for the defence of the Common-wealth, when néed ſhall be. The Apoſtle yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this reaſon, to make them of his time more willingly to giue ſuch aid, <hi>For they are Gods Miniſters,</hi>

               <hi>applying themſelues for the ſame thing;</hi> that is, for incouragement of the godly, and the repreſſing of euill whereof he wrot, <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> And therupon he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this exhortation, <hi>Giue to all men their dutie, tribute to whom tribute, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honor is due, Verſe 7.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> would haue

            <p>
               <hi>Q. Doth this Commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire yet any further duty to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to them that are our gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours?</hi>

And this prayer for our gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, is not the leaſt teſtimonie of a true affection that we haue to honour them, if our prayer for them be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent: neither is this duty to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed onely for Princes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but for Parents alſo, although I thought good eſpecially in this place to ſpeake thereof, becauſe the words of the Apoſtle are herein ſo plaine and pregnant, yea, it is a duty generally to be performed for all, not onely our ſuperiours, but alſo for inferiors.</p>

Hee is a meſſenger from GOD, the Commandements which hee bringeth (if he be faithfull in his Miniſterie) are from that great Commander, whoſe Lawes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to Parents and Children, Kings and Subiects, Maſters and Seruants, yea, to all ſorts, ſexes and ſtates that are, they belong not onely to this preſent life, but teach vs how to attaine to the life that laſteth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. To be ſhort, this office is to beate downe by threatnings out of Gods Law, the proud and haughtie hearts, to comfort with the ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell, the conſciences burthened with ſinne, to breake the Bread of Life to the hungry, and as faithfull ſtewards, to giue to euery one their portion in due ſeaſon: the Apoſtle therefore, not without great cauſe, admoniſheth <hi>that we haue them in ſingular loue,</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20189:72"/> and all ſuperiours, are in regard of their ſuperiority Gods Images, and therefore as his deputies muſt bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and thoſe ſparks of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty that ſhine in them as Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, muſt bee reuerenced: but the chiefe honour that can bee done to the Miniſter, is the obedience to his Word, and hee is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as Gods meſſenger, who is ſent to teach Gods will, therefore his office is highly to be eſteemed of, and hee in doing his office is to bee heard, his words to bee receiued with reuerence, that they being printed in our heart, may alſo by Gods good grace work in vs newneſſe of life, and a godly reformation.

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, as in other callings, ſo in this too: <hi>The workeman is worthy of his wages,</hi> as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught vs, who alſo learned that leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Sauiour Chriſt:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.10 Gal. 6.6.</note> therefore the ſame Apoſtle thus exhorteth, <hi>Let him who is taught in the word, make

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.11.</note> 
               <hi>If wee haue ſowne vnto you ſpirituall things, is it a great thing if we reape your carnall things?</hi> Nay, he plainely affirmeth, that if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be made partakers of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things of Gods people, their duty is to miniſter to them in carnall things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. This is a leſſon very needfull to bee taught in many places of this Realme, where very ſmall penſions are appointed to the Miniſter of the Word, and that cauſeth ſmall teaching of the people in ſuch places, though (for the moſt part) the number of the people where is leaſt maintenance, is very great. Yea, and where there is by law reaſonable maintenance eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Miniſter of the Word, yet the hearts of many of the people are not open enough to part from that which they ought to giue both by Gods Law and mans. For howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tythes are due (whether by Gods Law or not) to the Miniſter: yet, that beeing appointed for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20189:73"/> then Gods Law commandeth that euery man ſhould haue his due. But many of vs may iuſtly take vp the complaint of the Prophet, or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the wrongfull dealing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as hee did in his dayes, when hee charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay (for their deeds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it) <hi>The Table of the Lord is not to be regarded.</hi>

               <hi>bring vp your children in inſtruction and information of the Lord.</hi> In the booke of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> it is a charge very often giuen vnto Parents to teach their children Gods Law. Yea, it is worth marking, how in all their extraordinary ceremonies or actions the children were inſtructed what was meant thereby. As if the children ſhould inquire when they ſaw their fathers to eate in ſuch ſort as they did the Paſchall Lambe; they muſt teach them that it was to put them in mind how the Lord ſpared the houſes of the Iſraelites (wherein the Paſſeouer was eaten, as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded) when he ſmote the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Exo. 12.27</note> when the children ſhould demaund, what was meant by the putting apart the firſt borne, they muſt ſay, that therby

               <hi>A.</hi> The firſt is loue. For as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt loue their newe borne babes, ſo muſt they ſtill continue their louing affection. It is a debt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be in paying, yet neuer ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payd, ſo long as he liueth to whom it is due.

They muſt bee of that mind concerning their children, that <hi>Samuel</hi> was of concerning the Iſraelites: <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. I ſee Parents, as they are of their

But let vs now heare ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the duties of Gouernours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Gouernours and all ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, if they knowe how to behaue themſelues as Parents ouer their children, will ſoone learne what due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they muſt perform as ſuperiors, to their inferiors. For the very title of fathers and mothers whereby here they are noted, teacheth them that they muſt vſe the talent of authority which God hath giuen them, with a tender affection to the good of them who are placed vnder them. And loue, if it bée ſuch as the Apoſtle teacheth it ſhould be, <hi>out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and faith vnfained,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.5</note> will make men to ſtudy and labour by all meanes they can, to bee profitable in

            <p>
               <hi>Q. I ſee then, that fatherly loue muſt be in the hearts of Magiſtrates, or els how great ſo euer their authority is, ſuch as are vnder them, ſhall not feele any good or comfort by their gouernment. But what duties doth God who hath ſet them ouer other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them towards ſuch as are committed to their charge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Their firſt and chiefe care muſt be to maintaine the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by all meanes they can, and to take diligent héed, that lawes made to that end may duely bee executed. O how carefull was good King <hi>Dauid</hi> for the building of Gods houſe? And when it was told him, that not he, but his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould build it, hée made yet great preparation for that worke, and earneſtly incouraged hée his ſonne to build Gods houſe, and the Princes to further that building. When <hi>Dauid</hi> was dead, and <hi>Salomon</hi> eſtabliſhed in the kingdom, one of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20189:83"/> firſt works that he did, was the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods houſe.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 29.3. 2. Chr. 29.5.2. 2.

To this end alſo is the zeale of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in ſcriptures. By all which we learn, that Princes not only may, but muſt haue a great care to ſet forth true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and God requireth this duety of them, that their ſubiects by them ſhould bee brought to the loue of the truth, and deteſtation of ſinne and all Idolatrie. Great was the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Aſa</hi> herein and of his people, who <hi>made a couenant to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi>

So that to traine them vp in godlineſſe, and to be watchfull ouer them, for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt &amp; peaceable liuing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and their faithfull diſcharge of

               <hi>Wee ought rather to obey God then man, <hi>and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt, not regarding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of their gouernors.</hi>

               <hi>Whoſoeuer hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a murtherer.</hi> Enuy is another bad affection of the heart, that wiſheth often, ſometime alſo practiſeth the death of them whoſe good ſucceſſe they grieue at, as wee ſee in <hi>Cain</hi> who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Habel</hi> his brother,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.5.</note> becauſe God better accepted of <hi>Habels</hi> ſacrifice, then of his.

So that as Paſtors, and Maſters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in neglecting the duties aboue mentioned, put the ſoules of ſuch as are vnder them in danger of beeing hunger-ſtarued, for want of good food; ſo Magiſtrates omitting their dutie in puniſhing eſpecially bloudy and cruell offences, doe incourage offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; nay, ſtrengthen their hands to further miſchiefe, and by omiſſion of this dutie, may make themſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and partakers of other mens faults.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I thinke not. For the vagrant and wandering perſons, which with moſt importunitie ſeeke for reliefe, firſt leade an idle, and therefore an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20189:97"/> life (for <hi>abundance of idleneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eze. 16.49</note> was one of the crying ſins of <hi>Sodom.</hi>) Secondly, they are commonly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue moſt filthily without feare and ſhame. Thirdly, as they are not any members of the common-wealth wherein they liue: ſo they are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to any particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Church, and the moſt of them ſcarcely come at any: Now for ſuch people ſo hatefull to God and good men, in reſpect of their lewdneſſe, to bee fed and clothed whereſoeuer they come, is nothing els but to cheriſh and maintaine them in their wicked courſe, againſt moſt Chriſtian and godly lawes. Not to relieue their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may be thought a want of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Two things are therefore for reformation of theſe vnchriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, to be wiſhed rather (I feare) then hoped for. The one, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of this rogueing life with all ſharpneſſe, the other, diligent and carefull endeuour to ſet to work ſuch as are able (or els <hi>let not him eat that will not labour;</hi>

And how vnwilling ſoeuer theſe vagrants are to be tyed to one place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by doe much hinder the execution of our godly lawes; yet were it the part of them, to whom authority is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to combine themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put in practice ſuch Chriſtian lawes, tending ſo much to abandon lewdneſſe and idleneſſe of life, and to doe it with reſolution not to be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſcouraged for any paines. And thus much of the omiſſion of dueties, whereby we may bee made tranſgreſſors of this now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Hitherto you haue ſpoken of the prohibition: it now remaineth that you ſpeake of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt, who is the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of this law, and of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the ſecond Table, ſaith, loue is commanded in them all, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22 39</note> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth loue to bee the fulfilling of the lawe.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.10</note> Now loue, if it be vnfained and hearty, <hi>not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20189:98"/> in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth, 1. Ioh. 3.18.</hi> bringeth forth two fruites: The one is a reſcuing from euill, the other doing of good to them whom we loue. But to ſpeake particularly of the fruits or effects of loue, it is not néedfull, ſince wée haue already declared what is forbidden. For as we are forbidden to hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in body, name, or goods; yea, or to think or wiſh vncharitably to them or any thing belonging to them: ſo on the contrary, by this commandement we are bound to haue a tender care of the ſafety, welfare, and reputation of others, as well as of our owne. For the loue wee owe, or at the leaſt ſhould owe to others, muſt not haue any other meaſure, then the loue wee beare to our ſelues. And to be ſhort, as wée will be carefull not to omit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that maketh for our ſafety, wealth, or credit: ſo carefull muſt we be to cheriſh and maintaine theſe things for other. And thus much for the ſixt Commandement.</p>

               <hi>Q. <hi>The ſeuenth Commandement
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20189:99"/> is alſo a prohibiting or forbidding of that which is euill.</hi> Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery. <hi>And is adultery onely forbidden?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Adultery in the proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, when the huſband not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelfe with his wife, or the wife with her huſband, commit folly with others.

               <hi>neither ſhall any woman ſtand before a beaſt to lye downe thereto: for it is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi> and the puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is death both to the man or woman ſo vnnaturally offending, and to the beaſt. The ſin of <hi>Sodom</hi> is likewiſe forbidden;<note place="margin">Leu. 18.22</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not lye with a Male, as one lyeth with a woman. They muſt dye the death.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Theſe are monſtrous and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins, ſuch as it can hardly be thought that any of Gods people would euer commit, eſpecially that lying with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20189:99"/> beaſts. Neither do I remember that euer I read, that any of the people of Iſrael were charged therewith in all the Scriptures.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True: But we muſt know that God giueth not this commandement in vaine: but ſéeing no ſinnes are ſo groſſe but that men may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them, vnleſſe God by his grace reſtrain and bridle them, it is néedefull that God ſhould warne them thereof, leſt being careleſſe and ſecure, and truſting too much in their own deteſtation of ſuch ſinnes, they might vpon a ſudden at vnwares bee taken. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it did cleaue too faſt euen to the houſe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> For as <hi>there were Sodomites in the land</hi> in the daies of <hi>Rehoboam;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 14.24.</note> ſo when <hi>Aſa,</hi> his grand-child, a good King, did his beſt to put them away (for of him it is written,<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>the Sodomites which remained in the days of Aſa his father,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20189:100"/> hee put cleane out of the land.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the care theſe two good Kings had to aboliſh that filthy ſinne, yet about thrée hundred yeeres after, this ſin was crept, not into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Iuda,</hi> or city of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the Temple it ſelf;<note place="margin">2. King. 23.7.</note> and <hi>Ioſiah broke downe the houſes of the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites that were in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And therfore, how vnnaturall ſoeuer this ſin may ſeeme to bee, yet was it too well liked of Gods owne people, and therefore in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement forbidden, as alſo all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of the fleſh is of any ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>What thinke you of inceſtuous mariages, or the vnlawfull company of neere Kinsfolke?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All thoſe are forbidden by the Lawe of God, <hi>Leuit. 18.</hi> and alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt this Commandement.

And this you ſet downe as moſt certain, that whoſoeuer oppreſſe others, are tranſgreſſours againſt this Commandement, and may be called cruell theeues.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20189:107"/> which other may not meddle with, but as from them. Theſe Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies haue alwaies been euill thought of among wiſe gouernours, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Roman Lawes, and are by experience found to bee very hurtfull to Common-wealths: for by inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the prices of ſuch things as they haue ingroſſed, they ſteale away the wealth of the comminaltie.

For euery minute they iudged an hower,<note place="margin">Amos 8.4 5, 6.</note> they longed ſo much and ſo greedily after their vnlawfull gaine. But in theſe our daies ſuch kind of men are ſo much the worſe, becauſe they wil not ſticke ſometime to prophane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

To be ſhort, they may truly

Witneſſes, although they ſpeak not (in ſuch caſe) vpon oath, yet ought in honeſty, nay in Chriſtianity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a good conſcience, and not to ſpeak vntruly. For if they doe, they tranſgreſſe againſt this law. As for them who as friends are appointed to arbitrate and order ſuch matters, if they be ſtiffe for a friend, againſt that which, by witneſſes, ſhall appeare to be truth, and thereupon giue their or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der accordingly; they then beare falſe witnes againſt their neighbour. For all the friendſhip that a true Chriſtian friend can ſhewe to his friend in this caſe, is to take heede that hee bee not wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, neither the witneſſes words wreſted; but if hee yeelde not to the truth, he is a tranſgreſſor. As for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are broght before Iudges to giue their euidence, becauſe they are ſworn to ſpeake the truth, if they doe it not, their fault is much the greater. <hi>Thou

So this gréeuous tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and very vnchriſtian courſe of life, commended and approued of ſome with too much applauſe, is after ſome ſort warranted to breake this lawe of God. Another ſort tranſgreſſe in giuing themſelues praiſe,<note place="margin">Pro. 27.2</note> which were fitter to bee done by ſome other.

They call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Catholicke; it is not their name, it no way belongeth to them. Their church is not catholick, their faith is not catholick; therfore themſelues not catholick. Their church, nay not any church can here be catholick truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo long as this world indureth, all the members ſhal not be added to it, and vntill the number bee complete, it cannot bee called catholick properly. And therefore we beleeue that there is a holy Catholicke Church, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the true faith therein taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeable to the firſt promiſe of faith, and doctrine of obedience, which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all ages among the godly, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholicke, but then in déed ſhall be truly made Catholicke, when it ſhall haue the whole number added to it.

As for theirs, I ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will be aſhamed to ſay it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, many points whereof are ſo newly hatched; yea and ſome principal points which they hold not yet well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon that if they would ſay their faith is catholick, their owne mouthes and pens would reproue, yea ſtrongly confute them.

               <note place="margin">Prou. 10.6</note> as Papiſts with the plauſible name of Catholicke hide their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies: yet ſhall theſe patrons of poperie (I doubt not) find by their owne experience, that becauſe they haue ſaid to the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes from the faith, Thou art catholick; that is,<note place="margin">Pro. 24.24</note> 
               <hi>to the wicked, Thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the people ſhal curſe them, and the multitude ſhall abhor them,</hi> as already all ſuch, as by the light of Gods word ſee how damnable and dangerous their doctrine is.</p>

               <hi>Q. What thinke you of the tenth Commandement? Is there any thing forbidden therein, which is not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the other Commandements?

But here we may learn,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7</note> that ſéeing euen Luſt it ſelf is a breach of Gods Law, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, as before is ſaid; we muſt neither beléeue ſuch Commentaries of Gods Law, which teach the obedience therto to conſiſt in the outward performance only, as did the Scribes &amp; Phariſes,<note place="margin">Math. 5.20</note> whom therefore our Sauiour Chriſt reproueth, <hi>verſ. 21.27.</hi> neither iuſtifie our ſelues in any thing that we can do, ſeeing perfit obedience is ſo hard; nay, ſo vnpoſſible for man to attaine vnto, ſo long as we are in the fleſh: for theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto ſin will euer be ſtirring, as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20189:118"/> a root howſoeuer oft ſtubbed, yet, while it liueth, will euer be ſprouting. The third and laſt vſe thereof is, that it is a preparatiue to the performance of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty, which God requireth of vs: For, God hath created vs excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creatures, indued with reaſon, &amp; inabled by many good helps, to the end we ſhould by our holy obedience glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Him.<note place="margin">Math. 7.18</note> But <hi>an euil tree cannot bring forth good fruit:</hi> &amp; ſuch trées are we, if Luſt raign in vs, &amp; had are our fruits. Therfore to euery one of vs, who haue a deſire that <hi>our light ſo ſhine before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 5.16</note> 
               <hi>that they ſeeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Luſt.</hi> For Luſt is as leauen that ſowreth and maketh vnſauorie all our actions: The end therefore of this Commandement is,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.22</note> 
               <hi>That caſting off, concerning our conuerſation in time paſt, the old man, wee cleanſe our ſelues from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.1.</note> 
               <hi>and grow vp vnto ful holines in the feare of God: That being ſanctified throughout,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.23.</note> 
               <hi>our whole ſpirit, and ſoule, and body, may
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20189:118"/> be kept blameleſſe vntill the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Vnto which holineſſe, that we may truely ſtriue to attaine as wee ought to do, wee muſt carefully regard this Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>It ſeemeth, that raſh wiſhes for ſome things which either we ſee other inioy, or our ſelues vpon ſome occaſion thinke we want, are againſt this Law.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True: for euen thoſe motions argue a diſcontentedneſſe of our owne eſtate, and a wiſhing of better then God hath giuen vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>The ſeuerall things that we are forbidden to couet, haue beene before handled in the ſeuenth &amp; eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſo that heere wee neede not any further declaration thereof.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo: for that that wée are in them forbidden to do, or ſo much as we purpoſe or be willing to performe, we are here forbidden to luſt after, or to ſuffer within vs any motion to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>If Gods Commandements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo ſtrict and holy and perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20189:119"/> that it permitteth not ſo much as any wandring thought at any time to bee cheriſhed within vs, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our owne infirmity and weakenes to withſtand ſinne; nay, our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inclination to fall from our ſincerity in performance of our duety; it ſeemeth it is impoſſible for any man (CHRIST only excepted, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was by the holy Ghoſt) to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the lawe.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. <hi>Why then are wee blamed as tranſgreſſors, if God require more of vs in his lawe then any man (euen the beſt that liueth) is able to performe?</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Wee are iuſtly blamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God requireth no more at our hands, then man by his firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made able to performe. For, the Lawe that now wee haue, was written in the table of mans heart at his creation, and our firſt Parents to whom it was giuen were inabled to doe it. Now that they through their diſobedience, whereof both were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, <hi>Eue</hi> in intiſing, <hi>Adam</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20189:119"/> perſwaded, haue loſt that ability to doe the good they would and ſhould doe, it is their fault; for GOD crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them good and holy. And as the corruption of bloud, euen by mans laws, diſableth all the poſterity, when the father hath committed ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous fault:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14</note> euen ſo in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin wee are all tranſgreſſours. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in commaunding perfit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, commaundeth no more then of right hee might doe: and wee by our diſobedience deſerue blame, becauſe it is our owne corruption that diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth vs, that wee cannot doe what wee are commanded; yea and what we willingly would doe, being now regenerated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. VVhat vſe then haue wee of the lawe, ſince we are not able to keep it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is a true glaſſe, wherein if we looke without partialitie, we ſhall behold our ſelues as we are, that is, ſinners.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20 Rom. 5.20 Gal. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> Yea, by it ſinne is made vnto vs more manifeſt.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:20189:120"/>
            <p>Seeing then our ſelues by the lawe to be far from all hope of ſaluation, it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to ſéek elſewhere to obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in which reſpect it may be well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.24</note> 
               <hi>A Schoole-maſter to Chriſt,</hi> &amp; not only in reſpect of the Ceremonial laws which were but figures and ſhadowes, Chriſt the truth &amp; the body. For when we ſée it vnpoſſible for the law to ſaue vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3</note> 
               <hi>in aſmuch as it is weake, becauſe of the fleſh,</hi> then muſt we ſéeke vnto him, whom God <hi>ſent in ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.3</note> 
               <hi>and for ſin,</hi> by whom alſo, <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. The moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable vſe then that we may haue by the law, is not to hope by obſeruing or keeping it, to merit at Gods hands the kingdome of glory, as Papiſts do, being ſo blinded in conceit of their own works, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vnperfect, being tried by the touch-ſtone of the law, as in truth they are; but to looke vnto the remedy that God of his endleſſe and infinite mercie hath prouided againſt our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; namely, to the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath wrought.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13</note> 
               <hi>For <hi>Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20189:120"/> vs from the curſe of the law, when he was made a curſe for vs.</hi> But haue wee no other vſe of Gods lawe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: it is to vs as to a workman his rule and ſquare, according to which we ought to frame all our actions. And if any thing that we doe, agrée not with this rule, wee muſt not onely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it not to be right, but to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power we muſt indeuour to reforme it according to the rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. The promiſes then of the Goſpel free vs not from obedience of the Lawe. No;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.31. Mat. 5.17</note> 
               <hi>God forbid (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) that it ſhould ſo be. And Chriſt telleth them of his time, <hi>Thinke not that I am come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the law or the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfill them.</hi> So that although the lawe can now bring no condemnation to the godly that are in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1</note> Yet are we ſtill bound to the obſeruation or keeping of the lawe of the commandements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This to be true, many anſweres that Chriſt gaue to ſuch as aſked what they ſhould doe to inherit eternall life, do plainly proue; for he willed them to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20189:121"/> kéepe the commandements: To loue God with all their heart, ſoule, and ſtrength, and their neighbour as their ſelfe: Yea, after him all the doctrine of the Apoſtles tendeth to that end; yea, our accuſing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience when we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe them, and our excuſing heart, when in ſome good meaſure wee ſtriue to doe them, is a ſtrong witneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelues to teſtifie, that wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelues bound to obey them.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore wee cannot ſo keepe them as we ought to doe, though God in iuſtice may require this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vs, &amp; puniſh our diſobedience: Let vs humble our ſelues in feruent and faithfull prayer, crauing the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his grace in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obey his will, and pardon for our weakneſſe and imperfection in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, that of his meere mercy, and (by vs) vndeſerued grace we may eſcape deſerued wrath, in the day of wrath.</p>
